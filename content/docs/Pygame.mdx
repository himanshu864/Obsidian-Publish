# Installation

1. Download and install `python` from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install `pygame` using `pip`.

```zsh
pip3 install pygame
```

---
# Getting Started

```python
import pygame
from sys import exit # closes entire code

pygame.init()

screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600)) # set resolution
pygame.display.set_caption("Dark Souls") # window name
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

while True: # rendering until QUIT
    for event in pygame.event.get(): # check all events
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: # red cross click
            pygame.quit()
            exit()
    # draw all our elements
    # update everything
    pygame.display.update()
    clock.tick(60) # frame rate
```

---
# Surface

1. **Display Surface**:
	- The game window.
	- Is always displayed.
	- Must be unique.
2. **(regular) surface:**
	- A single image (imported), color, text.
	- Needs to be on *display surface* to be visible.
	- Flexible amount.

#### **`blit`**: block image transfer

```python
# sky_suface = pygame.image.load("graphics/Sky.png")
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
text_surface = pygame.Surface((200, 200))
text_surface.fill('Green')

while True:
	screen.blit(text_surface, (20, 50))
```

Rendering `text_surface` at $[20, 50]$ on display surface.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202025-01-28%20at%2011.17.26%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-28 at 11.17.26 PM.png" />
Notice, `text_surface` renders 20px to left and 50px down. Hence,

> In @@PLACEHOLDER26@@ coordinates starts from @@PLACEHOLDER58@@ at top left and @@PLACEHOLDER59@@ goes from left to right, while @@PLACEHOLDER60@@ goes from up to down.

#### Render Text

Anti-aliasing : Smooth edges

```python
test_font = pygame.font.Font("font/Pixeltype.ttf", 50) # None, default
text_surface = test_font.render("my text", False, 'Black')

while True:
    screen.blit(text_surface, (150, 50))
```

# Animation

Animations in `pygame` are achieved by cycling through a sequence of images (frames) over time. Example: Snail Rendering and Animation

```python
screen.blit(img[snail_index // 5], (snail_x, GROUND_Y - img[0].get_height()))
snail_index = (snail_index + 1) % 10

snail_x -= SNAIL_SPEED
if snail_x < -snail_width:
	snail_x = WINDOW_WIDTH
```

Here we are changing snail frame at $5$ fps using `snail_index`. And are changing snail's x-coordinate at `SNAIL_SPEED` to make it infinitely loop from end to start.

<Callout type="info">
Be sure update background when animating, otherwise we get strange lagging results.
</Callout>

### `convert() and convert.alpha()`

Use `convert()` for solid background and `convert.alpha()` while loading images for better optimization and faster gameplay when working with `pygame`.

# Rectangle

Useful for

1. Precise placement of surface.
2. Basic Collision.

By default, we place surface using top left co-ordinates. But that can get tricky. Use rectangles for easy access and placements.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202025-02-02%20at%202.27.34%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-02 at 2.27.34 PM.png" />

```python
# uncommon method to draw a rectangle
# player_rect = pygame.Rect(left, top, width, height)

# Common: To draw a rect. around a surface
player_surf = pygame.image.load("graphics/Player/player_stand.png")
player_rect = player_surf.get_rect(topleft = (800, 200))

while True:
	screen.blit(player_surf, player_rect) # render
	player_rect.x += 1 # move
	if player_rect.right >= 800:
		player.rect.left = 0
```

---
# Collision

To check if `rect1` is colliding with `rect2`.

```python
rect1.colliderect(rect2) # returns 0 or 1
```

To check if `(x, y)` point collides with `rect`.

```python
rect.collidepoint((x, y))
```

---
## Mouse

To get position of mouse. Returns `(x, y)` co-ordinates.

```python
pygame.mouse.get_pos()
```

To get mouse buttons pressed. Returns `(True, False, False)` if left button pressed. Similarly for middle and right button.

```python
pygame.mouse.get_pressed()
```

To get position of mouse while moving.

```python
while True:
	for event in pygame.event.get():
		if event.type == pygame.MOUSEMOTION:
			print(event.pos) # (x, y)
```

To check if mouse button is pressed or released.

```python
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
            print("mouse button was pressed")
        if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            print("mouse button was released")
```

---
# Draw Rectangle with colors

To draw any shape of any size & color, use 
`pygame.draw.shape(surface, color, (x,y))`
`pygame.draw.shape(surface, color, (x,y), width, border radius)`

```python
pygame.draw.rect(screen, 'Pink', score_rect)
screen.blit(score_surf, score_rect) # before to blit text after background

pygame.draw.line(screen, 'Black', (0, 0), (800, 400))
```

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202025-02-05%20at%203.31.10%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-05 at 3.31.10 PM.png" height= {500} width= {500} />

# Keyboard Inputs

To detect jumping

```python
while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE and not is_jumping:
	                is_jumping = True

    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed() # get all keys states
    if keys[pygame.K_SPACE]:
        print("Space is pressed rn!")
```

Can work with keydowns and key ups separately for more control.

---
# Get Time

```python
curr_time = pygame.time.get_ticks()
```

---
# Transform

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202025-02-07%20at%2010.19.41%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2025-02-07 at 10.19.41 PM.png" height= {500} width= {500} />

```python
player_double = pygame.transform.scale2x(player_stand)
# OR 
player_bigger = pygame.transform.rotozoom(player_stand, 0, 2)
```

`rotozoom` takes 3 args. Surface, rotate angel, and zoom float.

---
# Set Timer

**Timer**: Custom user event that is triggered in a certain time intervals.

1. Create custom event.
2. Tel `pygame` to trigger that event continuously.
3. Add code in the event loop.

```python
# +1 on custom event to avoid conflicts
obstacle_timer = pygame.USEREVENT + 1

# Trigger intervally (custom_event, interval in ms)
pygame.time.set_timer(obstacle_timer, 1200)

while True:
	for event in pygame.event.get():
		if event.timer == obstacle.timer:
			# code
```

---
# Sprite Class

A class that contains a *surface* and a *rectangle*; and it can be drawn and updated very easily.

To organize all code snippets of a class into a single place. Player, all snails and flies will be their own sprite.

We can't use `screen.blit()` to display sprite. Here, we need to
1. Place all sprites inside a group or groupSingle
2. And Draw/Update all of them at the same time.
	- Group: A group of multiple sprites (snails and flies)
	- GroupSingle: A group with a single sprite. (player)

> Enemies with collision must be in different groups.

```python
# Create Sprite Class
class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__() # calls parent classes constructor (Sprite)
        self.image = pygame.image.load("graphics/Player/player_stand.png")
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(bottomleft=(100, GROUND_LEVEL))

# Add To Groups
player = pygame.sprite.GroupSingle()
player.add(Player())

# Draw Groups
while True:
	player.draw(screen)
```

By default sprites support `image` and `rect` attributes. But can create custom attributes like `self.falling_speed` and functions like `def player_jump(self):` and so on.

To call all the custom functions to defined, you can use a built-in method `def update()` along with `player.draw(surface)`.

```python
class Obstacle(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self, type):
        super().__init__()
        self.type = type
        self.image = self.frames[0]
		self.rect = self.image.get_rect(bottomleft=[800, 300])

	def animation(self):
		self.rect -= ENEMY_SPEED

    def destroy(self):
        if self.rect.right < 0:
            self.kill()

    def update(self):
        self.animation()
        self.destroy()


# Create group
obstacle_group = pygame.sprite.Group()

# Append enemies
while True:
	for event in pygame.event.get():
		if event.type == obstacle_timer:
			obstacle_group.add(Obstacle(choice(["SNAIL", "SNAIL", "FLY"])))
```

### Collision in sprites

Use `spritecollide(sprite, group, dokill)` to check if the `sprite` is collide with which members of the `group`, and set `dokill` to true, if you want to kill member after collision.

Use `player.sprite` to access player sprite.

Use `obstacle_group.empty()` to clear all obstacles.

# Music

```python
# import sound
jump_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("audio/jump.mp3")

# play sound
jump_sound.play()
# .play(loops = -1) # for infinite loops, +ve for fixed number of loops

# adjust volume
jump_sound.set_volume(0.5)
```

That's it.
