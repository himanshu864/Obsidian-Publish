# UNIT 1

## Internet
---

> The **Internet** is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standard protocols. It allows users to access and share information, use web services, and communicate via emails, chats, and video calls. Think of it as a giant web connecting devices worldwide.

The Internet refers to the global information system that is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons and is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein.

### How the Internet Works?

Basically a lot of data is stored at lots of *servers* all over the world.

For example, Google is stored at multiple locations inside many high level computers called servers.

This data could be transferred to us using satellites but that would mean too much delay.

That's why we have laid out *Optical Fiber* cables on over the world. From mountains to under the ocean. These fiber transmit data to our internet routers or nearby cell towers. Though which we can request and update information.

That's basically *Internet*.

To identify unique addresses, each device connected to internet is given an *IP address*.

Similarly all servers / websites are given as IP addresses. Eg: Google's 8.8.8.8

But these address's are too hard to remember, that's why we assign them with unique *Domain Names*. Eg: www.google.com

And we use a telephone book called *DNS* server (Domain Name System) to find the corresponding IP address.

After getting the IP address, the browser forwards the request to server. And so on..

The server sends the data is the form of a huge amount of 0's and 1's.

This data is sent in small chunks called *packets*. Each packet chooses the shortest path to reach your device and is again reassembled using their Serial numbers.

*Protocols* set the rules for this complex flow of data packets. Like, conversion, address allocation, routers, etc.

### Internet Growth

- **1960s-70s**: Started as ARPANET, a small research network to connect universities.
- **1980s**: Expanded into educational and research networks.
- **1990s**: Became public. The introduction of the **World Wide Web** (WWW) in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee brought browsers, web pages, and hypertext links, making the Internet user-friendly.
- **2000s-Present**: Massive growth with mobile devices, social media, cloud computing, and IoT (Internet of Things).

The number of users has exploded from a few researchers to over 5 billion people today!

### Owners of Internet

No one person or organization "owns" the Internet. It’s a decentralized system managed by:

1. **ISPs (Internet Service Providers):** Provide access to the Internet.
2. **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers):** Manages domain names and IP addresses.
3. **Governments and Organizations:** Create laws and policies.
4. **Content Providers:** Companies like Google, YouTube, and Facebook provide services and data that flow through the Internet.

### Anatomy of Internet

When information is sent across the Internet, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP: the networking-language computers use when communicating over the Internet) first breaks the information up into packets of data. The client computer sends those packets to the local network, Internet service provider (ISP), or online service. From here, the packets travel through many levels of networks, computers, and communications lines until they reach their final destinations. Many types of hardware help the packets on their way. These are:

**Hubs**, which link groups of computers together and let them intercommunicate through multiple ports.  
**Bridges**, which link local area networks (LANs) with each other.   
**Gateways**, which act like bridges, but also convey data between dissimilar networks.  
**Repeaters**_,_ which amplify the data at intervals so that the signal doesn't weaken.  
**Routers**, which ensure packets of data arrive at their proper destination across different technologies, media, and frame formats.  
**Servers**, which deliver web pages and other services as requested.  
**Client computers**, which make the initial request for Internet services, and run applications to handle those services.  
**Cables and/or satellite communications**, which make the hardware connections.  

All hardware units need common operating methods, basic instructions called protocols that specify to all parties how the data will be handled.

## ARPANET
---

- Created in 1969 by the **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)** in the U.S.
- Aimed to connect researchers and share data.
- Introduced packet switching (splitting data into packets to send faster and more efficiently).
- First node-to-node communication happened in October 1969 between UCLA and Stanford.

### Evolution of the Internet

- **1970s:** Introduction of TCP/IP protocol (backbone of modern Internet).
- **1980s:** NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) extended ARPANET for academic use.
- **1990:** ARPANET shut down, and the Internet as we know it began.
- **1991:** The **World Wide Web** was invented by Tim Berners-Lee.

### History of the World Wide Web

- Invented in **1989** at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee to allow researchers to share documents.
- Introduced three core technologies:

1. **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** For web pages.
2. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):** To access web pages.
3. **Web Browser:** Software to view web pages (like Chrome or Firefox).

- Revolutionized how we interact with the Internet, making it accessible and useful for everyone.

### Basic Internet Terminology

1. **IP Address**: A unique numerical label assigned to each device on the Internet (e.g., 192.168.1.1).
2. **Domain Name**: The human-readable address for websites (e.g., `google.com`), linked to IP addresses via DNS.
3. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**: The full web address used to access resources (e.g., `https://www.example.com`).
4. **HTTP/HTTPS**: Protocols for transferring web pages. HTTPS is secure (uses encryption).
5. **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Translates domain names into IP addresses.
6. **Bandwidth**: The amount of data transferred over a network in a given time (measured in Mbps or Gbps).
7. **Firewall**: A security tool to block unauthorized access to a network.
8. **ISP (Internet Service Provider)**: A company that provides Internet access.
9. **Router**: A device that connects your local network to the Internet.
10. **Cache**: Temporarily stored data for faster future access.

### Net Etiquette (Netiquette)

Netiquette refers to polite and responsible behavior online:

1. **Respect Privacy**: Do not share someone’s private information without consent.
2. **Avoid Spamming**: Don’t send irrelevant messages or overuse group chats.
3. **Use Proper Language**: Avoid offensive, vulgar, or all-caps text (seen as shouting).
4. **Acknowledge Sources**: Credit original creators for their work (e.g., images, articles).
5. **Think Before Posting**: Ensure your comments/posts are respectful and appropriate.
6. **Secure Your Accounts**: Use strong passwords and don’t share login information.
7. **Stay Safe**: Avoid clicking on suspicious links and report harmful behavior.

### Working of the Internet

The Internet functions like a global postal system, where data is sent in small packets to the destination.

## Switching
---

-  Switching in Computer Networks helps in deciding the best route for data transmission if there are multiple in a larger network.
- One to one connection

### Circuit Switching
- Before data transmission, connection will be established.
- Eg: Telephone Network

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-21%20at%201.37.38%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 1.37.38 PM.png" />

1. Connection
2. Data Transmission
3. Disconnection

### Message Switching
<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-21%20at%201.42.49%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 1.42.49 PM.png" />
- First message is broken into individual pieces, which are then reassembled at the Intermediary node.
- Then message is transferred as a complete unit and forwarded using *Store and Forward* mechanism.
- Not suited for streaming media and real time applications.

### Packet Switching
- Internet is a packet switching network.
- Message is broken into chunks called packets.
- Each packet is send individually.
- Each packet will have source and destination IP address with sequence number.
- **Sequence Number** will help the receiver to
	- Sort the packets
	- Detect missing packets
	- Send acknowledgements

#### 1. Datagram Approach - Packet Switching
<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-21%20at%201.51.24%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 1.51.24 PM.png" />
- Connectionless switching
- Each independent entity is called as *datagram*.
- Path is not fixed
- Intermediary nodes take routing decision to forward the packets using their destination information.

#### 2. Virtual Circuit Approach - Packet Switching
<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-21%20at%201.54.15%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 1.54.15 PM.png" />
- Connection Oriented Switching
- A preplanned route is established before sending the message
- Call request and call accept packets are used to establish the connection b/w sender and receiver
- Path is fixed for the duration of a logical connection

### Packet Switching Technology

Packet switching is the backbone of the Internet, dividing data into small pieces (packets) for efficient transfer:

1. **Data Splitting**:
	- When you send a file or request, it is divided into smaller packets (e.g., a video is split into chunks).
	- Each packet contains a header (source and destination info) and payload (the data).

2. **Routing**:
	- Packets travel independently through various routes across the Internet.
	- **Routers** decide the best path for each packet based on availability and speed.

3. **Reassembly**:
	- At the destination, packets are reassembled into the original file, even if they arrive out of order.

4. **Error Checking**:
	- If any packets are lost or corrupted during transmission, the receiving device requests a retransmission.

#### Advantages of Packet Switching
 
1. **Efficiency**: Maximizes network bandwidth as packets use available routes.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: If one route fails, packets can take alternative paths.
3. **Scalability**: Handles large amounts of traffic without crashing.

## IP Address
---

**IPv4** -&gt;

- Internet Protocol
- Every node in computer network is identified with help of IP address.
- Logical Address, since can change based on Location of device.
- Assigned dynamically, but can be manual.
- Represented in decimal and has 4 *octets* (x.x.x.x)
- 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255 (32bits)
- Decimal dotted notation and binary notation.

On UNIX based machines, type `ifconfig` inside terminal. to get your IP address. You'll see something like this

```bash
	inet 192.168.28.235 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.28.255
```

- That `inet` is current IP address. Given to you by your router. In my case, hotspot.
- The first three octets will stay the same in your network, called the *Network Portion*.
- And the last octet will change based on what device it's assigned to, is the *Host*.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-21%20at%202.34.35%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-21 at 2.34.35 PM.png" />

- If you want to exchange on the same network. I.e. IP have same Network Portion. We can directly do that.
- But If the network portion is different, then router will step in to transfer that data.
- Fun fact, Default Gateway is actually your router. (x.x.x.1)

###### Now how many devices can you host on the same network?

- You might think, since network portions remains the same. And its from 0-255. 256?
- WRONG!
- 192.168.1.0 is reserved for the first born Network Address
- 192.168.1.255 is reserved for the chatty *Broadcast Address*. He everything to everyone.
- 192.168.1.1 is reserved for your router, ofc.

So that's makes it a total of **253** different hosts! 

### Layering

Layering means decomposing the problem into more manageable components (layers)

Advantages:
- More modular design
- Easier to troubleshoot

**Protocols**: Set of rules that govern data communication

**Layer** **Architectures**
- OSI Reference Model
- TCP / IP Model

## OSI Model
---

- **Open System Interconnection**
- It is a model for understanding and designing a network architecture that is flexible, robust, and interoperable (exchange data b/w diff machines of diff types or OS).
- Developed by ISO (International Standards Organization)
- The OSI Model is not a protocol. It is only a guideline.
- The purpose of the OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software.
- The OSI Model was never fully implemented.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%203.39.13%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 3.39.13 PM.png" />
- First data is *encapsulated* from Application Layer -&gt; Physical Layer
- Then which is then forwarded using intermediary nodes (routers) which modify only the last three layers. Network, Data Link, and Physical
- Finally data is *de-encapsulated* to extract the data.

### 7 Layers of OSI Model

**Physical Layer**:
- Deals with physical connection
- Transmission of raw binary data (0's and 1's) over physical media (fiber optics, etc)
- Eg: Ethernet Cable, USB, Bluetooth

**Data Link Layer**:
- Ensures *error-free* data transfer between two devices on same network
- Divides data into *frames*
- Eg: MAC Addresses, Wi-Fi

**Network Layer**:
- Handles routing and addressing of data across different networks
- Divides data into *packets*, assigns IP address, chooses best path
- Eg: IPv4, routers

**Transport Layer**:
- Ensures reliable data delivery between devices
- Divides data into *segments*, provides error recovery, flow control and retransmission of lost packets.
- Eg: TCP, UDP

**Session Layer**:
- Manages and maintains connections (sessions) between devices
- Establishes, maintains and terminates sessions. Synchronous + dialog control
- Eg: APIs, NetBIOS

**Presentation Layer**:
- Translates data into a format application layer can understand
- Data encryption, compression and formatting. (from ACSII to Unicode)
- Eg: SSL/TLS, JPEG, MP3

**Application Layer**:
- Provides services directly to the end user
- Facilitates transfer related services like transfer, email and browsing.
- Acts as interface b/w user application and network
- Eg: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

## TCP/IP Model
---

- Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
- Backbone of internet.
- Practical model focusing on simplicity and speed.
- Tightly tied to protocols like TCP, IP, UDP.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%204.21.19%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 4.21.19 PM.png" />
### 4 Layers of TCP/IP Model

**Application**: Represents data to user, with encoding and dialog control.

**Transport**: Supports communication between different devices across different networks.

**Internet**: Determines the best path thought the network, assigns IP, etc

**Network Access**: Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network.

### Protocol Data Unit (PDU)
Named according to protocols of TCP / IP suite.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%204.32.10%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 4.32.10 PM.png" />

### Troubleshooting Internet Connectivity

Understanding network protocols and configurations is critical for diagnosing and resolving internet connectivity issues. Here's why:

#### **1. Protocol Knowledge**

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Ensures proper IP addressing, subnet masks, and routing are set.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Checks if domain resolution is functional and resolves incorrect DNS configurations.
- **TCP/UDP**: Verifies communication ports for applications and detects blocked or failing ports.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Ensures automatic assignment of IP addresses is functioning correctly.

#### **2. Configuration Checks**

- **IP Configuration**: Identifies incorrect static or dynamic IP settings (e.g., `ipconfig`/`ifconfig`).
- **Gateway and Subnet**: Ensures proper gateway routing and subnet mask alignment for local network communication.
- **Firewall/Proxy Settings**: Detects rules or proxy misconfigurations blocking access.
- **Wi-Fi and LAN Setup**: Diagnoses wireless or wired network adapter issues, including driver or signal problems.

#### **3. Troubleshooting Tools**

- **Ping and Traceroute**: Validates reachability and identifies network hops causing delays.
- **nslookup/dig**: Tests DNS resolution.
- **netstat**: Identifies open/active connections and their states.

## Routers
---

A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between different networks.

#### How Routers Handle Packets
 
1. A packet arrives at a router.
2. The router examines the **destination IP** in the packet's header.
3. It consults its **routing table** to determine the next hop.
4. The packet is forwarded accordingly, moving closer to its destination.

##### Router's Role in IP Addressing

- **Default Gateway**: A router acts as a bridge for devices in your local network to access external networks.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)**: Routers use NAT to allow multiple devices in a private network to share one public IP address for accessing the Internet.

#### Why Routers Are Important

1. **Scalability**: Enable millions of devices across the globe to connect without conflict.
2. **Security**: Can implement firewalls and filter malicious traffic.
3. **Reliability**: Provide alternate paths for data in case of network failures.

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
---

UDP is a lightweight, connectionless protocol used in the Transport Layer of the Internet protocol suite. Unlike TCP, it focuses on speed rather than reliability.

1. **Connectionless**:
- No need to establish a connection before sending data.
- Data is sent as independent packets (called datagrams).

2. **Unreliable:**
- Does not guarantee delivery, order, or error correction.
- Suitable for applications where speed is critical, and occasional data loss is acceptable.

3. **Use cases**:
- Streaming
- Video Gaming
- VoIP : Internet calls

## Subnets
---
### Internet Addressing Schemes

#### 1. Machine Addressing (IP Addressing)

This is how computers and devices are uniquely identified on a network.

1. **IP Address**:
    - Every device on the Internet has a unique IP address.
    - Two versions are commonly used:
        - **IPv4**: 32-bit address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
        - **IPv6**: 128-bit address (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
		
2. **MAC Address**:
    - A unique hardware address assigned to a device’s network interface card (NIC).
    - It operates at the Data Link layer and is formatted like `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.
	
3. **Private vs. Public Addresses**:
    - **Private IPs**: Used within local networks (e.g., `192.168.0.x`).
    - **Public IPs**: Used to identify devices on the Internet.
	
4. **Dynamic vs. Static IPs**:
    - **Dynamic**: Assigned temporarily by a DHCP server.
    - **Static**: Manually assigned and remains fixed.

#### 2. Email Addressing

Email addressing identifies users for sending and receiving messages.

1. **Format**:
    - An email address has three parts:
        - **Username**: The user’s unique ID (e.g., `john.doe`).
        - **@ Symbol**: Separates the username and domain.
        - **Domain**: Specifies the mail server (e.g., `gmail.com`).
		
    Example: `john.doe@gmail.com`
    
2. **MX Records**:
    - Mail Exchange (MX) records help route emails to the correct mail server for a given domain.
3. **Protocols Involved**:
    - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Sending emails.
    - **IMAP/POP3**: Retrieving emails.

#### 3. Resource Addressing

This refers to identifying and locating web resources, like websites or files.

1. **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)**:
    - A URL specifies the location and method to access a resource.
    - Format: `protocol://domain/path`
        - **Protocol**: How to access the resource (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).
        - **Domain**: Hostname or IP of the server (e.g., `www.example.com`).
        - **Path**: File or resource location (e.g., `/about.html`).
		
    Example: `https://www.example.com/products/item123`
    
2. **URN (Uniform Resource Name)**:
    - A persistent name for a resource, independent of its location.
    - Example: `urn:isbn:0451450523` (a book’s ISBN).
3. **DNS (Domain Name System)**:
    - Translates human-readable domain names (`google.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (`142.250.190.78`).

### Classes of IPv4 Address (*Classful*)

IP address classes categorize IPv4 addresses based on their **default network size** and **first octet**.
### **Key Features**
- **Class A**: Large networks.
	- Binary: First bit is `0`.
	- Range: `0.0.0.0 – 127.255.255.255`.
	- Default Mask: `255.0.0.0`.
- **Class B**: Medium-sized networks.
	- Binary: First two bits are `10`.
	- Range: `128.0.0.0 – 191.255.255.255`.
	- Default Mask: `255.255.0.0`.
- **Class C**: Small networks.
	- Binary: First three bits are `110`.
	- Range: `192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255`.
	- Default Mask: `255.255.255.0`.
- **Class D**: Multicasting.
	- Binary: First four bits are `1110`.
	- Range: `224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255`.
- **Class E**: Experimental.
	- Binary: First four bits are `1111`.
	- Range: `240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255`.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%205.06.44%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 5.06.44 PM.png" />

> Hence, to find out a class of an IP address. Simply convert first octet of Dotted-decimal notation into binary, and count no. of 1's in the beginning.

### Masks in IPv4 Addressing (*Subnet Mask*)

A mask in IPv4 addressing, also known as a subnet mask, is used to divide an IP address into two parts:

1. **Network Portion**: Identifies the network.
2. **Host Portion**: Identifies individual devices within that network.

The subnet mask determines which part of the IP address belongs to the network and which part belongs to the host.

### Default Masks for IPv4 Classes (*Subnet classes*)

Subnet classes divide an IP address space into **smaller subnets** using **subnet masks**.

- Subnet masks define the **network** and **host portions** of an IP address.
	- Example: `255.255.255.0` → Network (first 24 bits) and Host (last 8 bits).
- Custom subnet masks allow more flexibility:
	- Example: `255.255.240.0` (binary: `11111111.11111111.11110000.00000000`).

**Class A**
	- **Binary Notation**: 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000
	- **Dotted-Decimal Notation**: 255.0.0.0
	- **Network Portion**: First 8 bits (1st octet).
	- **Host Portion**: Last 24 bits (remaining 3 octets).
	- **IP Range**: 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255.
  
**Class B**
	- **Binary Notation**: 11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000
	- **Dotted-Decimal Notation**: 255.255.0.0
	- **Network Portion**: First 16 bits (1st and 2nd octets).
	- **Host Portion**: Last 16 bits (3rd and 4th octets).
	- **IP Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255.

**Class C**
	- **Binary Notation**: 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
	- **Dotted-Decimal Notation**: 255.255.255.0
	- **Network Portion**: First 24 bits (1st, 2nd, and 3rd octets).
	- **Host Portion**: Last 8 bits (4th octet).
	- **IP Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255.

- **IP Address Classes** define broad categories of IP ranges (A, B, C, etc.).
- **Subnet Classes** are subdivisions within those ranges using subnet masks.
- The subnet mask is essential for routing and defining subnets within larger networks.
- Modern networking uses **CIDR** for flexible and efficient IP allocation.

### Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)

Given the address **205.16.37.39/28**, let’s calculate the following:

**(i) First Address of the Block (Network Address)**
1. **CIDR Notation**: /28 means the subnet mask has 28 bits set to 1, and the remaining 4 bits are 0. The subnet mask in dotted decimal is **255.255.255.240**.

2. **Network Address**: The first address is obtained by setting the host bits (the last 4 bits) to 0.

- Convert 205.16.37.39 to binary:


- Retain only the network bits (first 28 bits) and set the last 4 bits to 0:


- First address : **205.16.37.32**

**(ii) Last Address of the Block (BroadCast Address)**

The last address is obtained by setting all the host bits (last 4 bits) to 1:

- **205.16.37.47**

**(iii) Total Number of Addresses**

1. The number of addresses in a /28 block is calculated as  $2^{(32 - 28)} = 2^4 = 16$

- **Total Addresses**: 16

2. However, 2 addresses are reserved:
	- Network address: 205.16.37.32.
	- Broadcast address: 205.16.37.47.

- **Usable Addresses for Hosts**:  16 - 2 = 14 .

# UNIT 2

## Email
---

Electronic Mail is a method of exchanging messages over the internet.

Email is send and received using a couple different protocols.

- **SMTP** is used for sending email
- **IMAP** and **POP3** is used for receiving email

#### Email basics
1. **Email address** unique identifier for each user
2. **Email Client**: Software program used to send, receive and message email
3. **Email Server**: Computer system responsible for storing and forwarding email

#### Components of E-Email System:
1. **User Agency (UA):** Program used to send, receiver, reply and read emails.
2. **Messaging Transfer Agency (MTA):**
	- Transfers mail from one system to another.
	- To send a mail, a system must have both client and system MTA
	- It transfers mail to mailboxes of recipients if they share a machine
	- Delivers to main to peer MTA if destination mailbox is in another machine using *Simple Mail Transfer Protocol*.
3. **Mailbox:** Fall on local hard drive to collect mails.

#### After email reaches SMTP server
1. Server will validate the emails contents in accordance to protocol.
	1. Now server will lookup IP address of recipients email server on DNS.
2. Now server will establish a connection, and send email is packets.
3. Which will be re-assembled at recipients server and scan email for virus or spam.
4. Finally server will put email to recipients mail box, for him to read.

### POP3 vs IMAP
- POP3 is simple. Only downloads contents on Inbox folder. While IMAP (*Internet Message Access Protocol*) syncs everything throughout all devices
- POP3 offline emails on device. While IMAP keeps everything on server.
- You can only view emails on POP3. While IMAP can also sent items, drafts, delete items, etc.

## Internet Chat
---

Real time text based communication between two or more users over the Internet. Mainly two types of web chat:
- **Instant messaging**: 1v1 b/w two ppl
- **Chat rooms**: This is a multi-user chat.

Advantage:
- Simple
- Accessible
- Real-time
- Cost-effective

Disadvantage:
- Security
- Improper use
- Spam

## Telnet
---

- Telecommunication Network
- Telnet is a network protocol that allows you to remotely connect to a computer and establish a two-way text-based communication between two computers.
- Creates remote sessions using TCP / IP protocols, controlled by logged in user to access privileged data and applications on that computer.
- Single operated port, hence only one connection at a time.
- Very old technology, no encryption and low security. Replaced by SSH.
- uses PORT 23

## Usenet
---

- User Network
- Computer network that allows users to share large files and discuss topics in newsgroups.
- Usenet is a decentralized discussion system that began in 1979 as a text-based system. It has evolved into a network with millions of users and thousands of newsgroups, which are similar to forums or subreddits.

## FTP
---

- File Transfer Protocol.
- Client/server protocol that allows you to transmit and receive files from a host computer.
- FTP authentication may be done via usernames and passwords.
- Can also use FTP anonymously using "guest" as ID.
- uses PORT 20 for data and 21 for control connection.
- Use TCP for File transfer.
- But no encryption and no security. Use *SFTP* for security (add a secure socket layer b/w FTP and TCP)
- data connection is non-persistent. Control is persistent
- Stable

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250520015737.png" alt="Pasted image 20250520015737.png" />

**Control Connection**
For sending control information like user identification, password, commands to change the remote directory, commands to retrieve and store files, etc., FTP makes use of a control connection. The control connection is initiated on port number 21.

**Data connection** For sending the actual file, FTP makes use of a data connection. A data connection is initiated on port number 20. FTP sends the control information out-of-band as it uses a separate control connection. Some protocols send their request and response header lines and the data in the same TCP connection. For this reason, they are said to send their control information in-band. HTTP and SMTP are such examples.

# UNIT 3

## HTTP
---

- **HyperText Transfer Protocol:** protocols used to exchange data on internet.
- widely used to fetch the webpages on www
- Isn't reliable itself, but uses TCP for reliability.
- Inband Protocol. (since data and commands transfer on the same port, unlike FTP)
- PORT 80
- *Stateless*
- Client server architecture - uses URL
- Media Independent
- HTTP 1.0 Non-persistent (connection based. sessions)
- HTTP 1.1 Persistent (connectionless. open)
- HTTPS: added Secure Socket Layer (*SSL*)
- Commands (head, get, post, put, delete, connect)

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2011.56.42%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-11-22 at 11.56.42 PM.png" />

## HTML
---

### HTML Features for Layout Creation:

**Semantic HTML5 Tags**:
- Tags like `<header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <nav>`, etc., allow developers to structure a page semantically and improve accessibility.
- Helps in creating distinct layouts such as blogs, news websites, or e-commerce platforms by organizing the content into sections.

**Forms and Controls**:
- Use `<form>, <input>, <button>, <select>, and <textarea>` to create interactive forms, such as login forms, contact forms, or search forms.
- **Example**: A search box layout in a navigation bar.

### HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents, defined by opening and closing tags, and typically consist of:

1. **Opening Tag**: Defines the start of an element, e.g., `<p>`.
2. **Content**: Text, nested HTML, or other content enclosed within the tags.
3. **Closing Tag**: Defines the end of the element, e.g., `</p>`.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
```

**Types of HTML Elements**:

1. **Structural Elements**: Define the layout (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
2. **Text Formatting Elements**: Style text (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`).
3. **Multimedia Elements**: Embed media (e.g., `<img>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`).
4. **Interactive Elements**: Handle user input (e.g., `<form>`, `<button>`).

### HTML Linking

Linking connects different parts of a webpage or external resources. The `<a>` tag is used for hyperlinks.

**Syntax**:
```html
<a href="URL" target="_target">Link Text</a>
```

**Attributes**:

1. **`href`**: Specifies the URL of the destination.
2. **`target`**:
    - `_self`: Default, opens in the same tab.
    - `_blank`: Opens in a new tab.

**Example**:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
```

### HTML Formatting Tags

HTML provides formatting tags to style and emphasize text.

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-12-02%20at%2011.36.20%20AM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 11.36.20 AM.png" />

### Defining Image in HTML

The `<img>` tag embeds an image in an HTML document.

```html
<img src="image_url" alt="description" width="value" height="value">
```

**Attributes**:

1. **`src`**: Specifies the image source URL.
2. **`alt`**: Describes the image for accessibility and when the image cannot be displayed.
3. **`width` and `height`**: Define the dimensions of the image.

## CSS
---

### CSS Features for Layout Creation:

**Flexbox**:
- A powerful layout tool for building responsive, flexible layouts.
- **Example**: A two-column layout that adjusts based on screen size, like in blogs or e-commerce sites.

**Grid Layout**:
- CSS Grid allows complex, multi-column layouts, ideal for applications that need intricate designs (e.g., dashboards, product pages).
- **Example**: A grid-based layout for showcasing products or articles.

**Media Queries**:
- CSS feature that applies styles based on screen size or device type.
- **Example**: Adjusting a website’s layout from a single-column design on mobile to a multi-column design on desktop.

### Different Levels of Style sheets in CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows for different levels of stylesheets to control the presentation of HTML documents. These levels determine the priority of styles applied to elements.

#### 1. **Inline Styles**

- Written directly within the HTML element's `style` attribute.
- **Priority**: Highest priority (overrides embedded and external styles for the specific element).
- **Example**:
```css
<p style="color: blue;">This is an inline styled paragraph.</p>
```

#### 2. **Internal (Embedded) Styles**

- Defined within the `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
- Applied to the entire document but cannot be reused across multiple files.
- **Priority**: Higher than external styles, but lower than inline styles.
- **Example**:
```css
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: green;
        }
    </style>
</head>
```

#### 3. **External Styles**

- Defined in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag.
- Allows consistent styling across multiple HTML files.
- **Priority**: Lowest priority compared to inline and internal styles but provides global reusability.
- **Example**:
```css
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

#### 4. **Browser Default Styles**

- Built-in styles applied by the web browser when no explicit CSS is defined.
- **Priority**: Lowest; overridden by all user-defined styles.

## Javascript
---

### Comparing two Date Objects

To compare two date objects, even if they are in different formats, JavaScript provides various methods. The common approach is to convert both dates to a comparable format, such as a **timestamp** (milliseconds since January 1, 1970).

```javascript
const date1 = new Date("2023-12-01T10:00:00"); // ISO format
const date2 = new Date("December 2, 2023 15:00:00"); // String format

if (date1.getTime() < date2.getTime()) {
    console.log("date1 is earlier than date2");
} else if (date1.getTime() > date2.getTime()) {
    console.log("date1 is later than date2");
} else {
    console.log("Both dates are equal");
}
```

#### **Steps in the Example**:

1. **Parsing Date Formats**: `new Date()` handles ISO, string, and numeric formats.
2. **Convert to Timestamps**: Use `.getTime()` to compare the dates as numeric values.
3. **Comparison**: Use standard comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`).

### Event Handling

Event handling refers to the process of capturing and responding to user interactions or browser events, such as clicks, keypresses, or mouse movements.

#### **Event Handling Methods**:

1. **Inline Event Handling**:
- Add event attributes directly to HTML elements.
- Example:
```jsx
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click Me</button>
```

2. **Using Event Listeners**:
- JavaScript provides `addEventListener()` to attach handlers to events dynamically.
- Example:
```jsx
<button id="myButton">Click Me</button>
<script>
    const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
    button.addEventListener("click", function() {
        alert("Button clicked via Event Listener!");
    });
</script>
```

3. **Directly Assigning Events**:
- Attach a function to an element's event property.
- Example:
```jsx
<button id="anotherButton">Click Here</button>
<script>
    const anotherButton = document.getElementById("anotherButton");
    anotherButton.onclick = function() {
        alert("Button clicked directly!");
    };
</script>
```

## PHP
---

PHP (*Hypertext Preprocessor*) is a server-side scripting language widely used for constructing dynamic web pages and managing backend processes.

### PHP for Presenting XML data

- **Dynamic Content Generation:** PHP can generate dynamic content based on user inputs, such as displaying personalized information after a login.

- **Database Integration:** PHP easily integrates with databases (e.g., MySQL) to pull data and display it in real-time on web pages.

- **Data Presentation in XML:**
	- PHP is highly effective for handling and processing XML data. PHP has built-in functions like `simplexml_load_string()` to parse XML files and present them as part of the web page.
	- It can interact with XML APIs, retrieve or send data in XML format, and integrate with web services using XML (e.g., RSS feeds).
	- *Example*: PHP can retrieve data from a database, format it in XML, and present it to a client’s browser or API consumer.

### PHP for reading file

1. **File Existence Check**:
    - Ensures the input file exists using `file_exists()`.
2. **Reading the Input File**:
    - Opens the file in **read mode** (`r`) using `fopen()`.
    - Reads the entire content using `fread()`.
3. **Writing to the Output File**:
    - Opens the file in **write mode** (`w`) using `fopen()`.
    - Writes the content to the output file using `fwrite()`.
4. **Closing Files**:
    - Ensures all file handles are properly closed with `fclose()`.

## Web Mining and frameworks.
---

Web mining refers to the process of discovering and extracting useful and actionable knowledge from web data. This includes data from web pages, web links, web server logs, and other online content. The aim is to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that can provide insights for decision-making, personalization, and other applications.

Web mining combines techniques from **data mining**, **machine learning**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **information retrieval** to analyze and extract information from the vast amount of unstructured and semi-structured data available on the web.

Data for web mining is collected via web crawlers, web logs, and other means.

The analysis of web usage provides feedback on the web content and also the consumer's browsing habits. This data can be of immense use for commercial advertising, and even for social engineering.

﻿﻿The Web could be analyzed for its structure as well as content.

### Web Mining Framework

The framework for web mining typically consists of three major components, categorized based on the type of data being analyzed:

<ImageZoom src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202024-12-01%20at%2011.44.05%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-01 at 11.44.05 PM.png" />

#### 1. Web Content Mining
Focuses on extracting useful information from the content of web pages.

**Content Types**:
- Text, images, audio, video, and structured data like tables and metadata.

**Techniques**:
- **Text Mining**: Uses NLP to analyze and extract patterns from text.
- **Multimedia Mining**: Analyzes multimedia data like images or videos.

**Applications**:
- Personalization (e.g., product recommendations).
- Opinion mining and sentiment analysis.

#### 2. Web Structure Mining
Analyzes the structure of the web, focusing on hyperlinks and interconnections between pages.

**Structure Types**:
- **Intra-page structure**: HTML/XML tags within a page.
- **Inter-page structure**: Links between web pages.

**Techniques**:
- **Graph Theory**: Represents web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges in a graph.
- **Algorithms**: PageRank and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search).

By using a systematic framework, web mining enables businesses and researchers to harness the vast amount of web data effectively.

## Web Crawling
---

Web crawling is the process of systematically browsing and downloading content from web pages using automated programs called _web crawlers_ or _spiders_. Web crawlers navigate through hyperlinks across the internet to collect data for search engines or other applications.

- **Purpose**: To index web pages for search engines (e.g., Google) or to gather data for analytics.
- **Process**: Starts with a list of seed URLs → fetches their content → extracts links → follows the links recursively.
- **Challenges**:
	- Handling dynamic pages and frequently updated content.
	- Avoiding overloading websites (politeness and rate limits).
- **Example**: Search engines like Google and Bing use web crawlers to discover new and updated web pages.

## Web Information Retrieval (Web IR) System
---

A Web Information Retrieval (Web IR) System is algorithm designed to search, retrieve, and rank relevant information from the web in response to user queries.

**Key Components**:
1. **Indexing**: Organizes web content into searchable indexes.
2. **Query Processing**: Interprets the user’s query to fetch relevant results.
3. **Ranking**: Orders results based on relevance using algorithms (e.g., PageRank).
4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Improves future searches using user behavior or relevance feedback.

**Applications**:
- Search engines (e.g., Google, Bing).
- Specialized systems (e.g., PubMed for medical articles).

## Recommendation System
---

Recommendation systems are algorithms that provide personalized suggestions to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or interactions.

**Types**:
1. **Content-Based Filtering**:
	- Recommends items similar to those a user has interacted with in the past.
	- Example: Netflix recommending a movie based on a user’s viewing history.

2. **Collaborative Filtering**:
	- Recommends items based on preferences of similar users.
	- Example: Amazon’s “Users who bought this also bought” feature.

3. **Hybrid Systems**:
	- Combines both content-based and collaborative filtering for better accuracy.

**Applications**:
- E-commerce (e.g., product recommendations).
- Streaming platforms (e.g., Netflix, Spotify).
- Social media (e.g., friend suggestions).

## Search Engine
---

Platforms that index and retrieve web content (hyperlinks), ranking results based on relevance and algorithms in response to user queries using Web IRs.

Together, Web IR provides the framework, while search engines operationalize it.

**Key Functions**:
1. **Web Crawling**: Collects data from web pages.
2. **Indexing**: Organizes data into a searchable format.
3. **Query Processing**: Matches user queries with the indexed data.
4. **Ranking**: Sorts results by relevance using ranking algorithms.

**Examples**: Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo.

**Core Technologies**:
- Algorithms (e.g., PageRank).
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for interpreting user queries.
