Okay, let's implement the DNS Resolver with TTL Caching in Python using only standard libraries as required.

This code will:

1. Build a raw DNS query packet.
2. Send it using UDP sockets.
3. Parse the raw DNS response packet.
4. Extract IPv4 addresses and TTL.
5. Implement a simple in-memory cache with TTL expiry.

**How to Run:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `dns_resolver.py`).
2. Run from your terminal: `python dns_resolver.py`
3. You can optionally provide a hostname as a command-line argument: `python dns_resolver.py example.com`

**Explanation:**

1. **Cache:** A simple dictionary `DNS_CACHE` stores results.
2. **`encode_dns_name`:** Converts standard hostnames into the required DNS label format (e.g., `3www6google3com0`).
3. **`parse_dns_name`:** This is crucial for reading names from the response. It handles the pointer/compression mechanism (where parts of a name point to earlier occurrences in the packet to save space). It carefully tracks the reader's position.
4. **`build_dns_query`:** Creates the byte sequence for a standard DNS 'A' record query, including a random Transaction ID, flags, and the encoded hostname.
5. **`parse_dns_response`:**
    - Unpacks the header and verifies the Transaction ID and flags.
    - Uses the `parse_dns_name` helper to skip the Question section.
    - Loops through the Answer Records (RRs) indicated by `ancount`.
    - For each RR, it parses the (potentially compressed) name.
    - It unpacks the RR type, class, TTL, and data length.
    - If it's an 'A' record (Type 1, Class 1) and the data length is 4, it uses `socket.inet_ntoa` to convert the RDATA bytes into an IP address string.
    - It keeps track of the _minimum_ TTL found among the relevant A records, as the cache entry should expire when the shortest TTL expires.
6. **`resolve`:**
    - Checks the cache first (if `use_cache` is True).
    - If not cached or expired, it calls `build_dns_query`.
    - Creates a UDP socket, sends the query, and waits for the response (with a timeout).
    - Calls `parse_dns_response`.
    - If successful, updates the cache with the IPs and calculated expiry time.
    - Returns the list of IPs or `None` on failure.
7. **`if __name__ == "__main__":`:** Contains example usage demonstrating resolution, cache hits, and potentially cache expiry.

# THEORY

Okay, let's break down the theory behind the Python DNS resolver we built.

**1. What is DNS? (The Big Picture)**

- **Analogy:** Think of DNS (Domain Name System) as the **phonebook of the Internet**.
- **Problem:** Humans remember website names like `www.google.com`, but computers connect to each other using numerical IP addresses (like `172.217.167.196`).
- **Solution:** DNS is the system that translates the human-friendly domain names into the computer-friendly IP addresses. When you type a website address in your browser, your computer (usually) performs a DNS lookup behind the scenes to find the correct IP address to connect to.

**2. The Core Process: Query and Response**

DNS works on a simple question-and-answer model:

- **Client (Your Resolver):** Needs the IP address for a hostname.
- **DNS Server:** Knows (or can find) the answers.
- **Query:** The client sends a **DNS Query packet** to the server asking, "What is the IP address (A record) for `www.google.com`?"
- **Response:** The server sends back a **DNS Response packet** saying, "The IP address for `www.google.com` is `172.217.167.196`, and you can consider this information valid for X seconds (the TTL)."

**3. DNS Packet Structure (The Message Format)**

Both Query and Response packets follow a specific binary format (defined mainly in RFC 1035). They aren't plain text. Our Python code manually constructs and interprets this binary format using the `struct` module.

- **Header (12 bytes):** Present in both queries and responses. Contains metadata:
    
    - **Transaction ID (ID):** A random 16-bit number chosen by the client. The server copies this ID into the response so the client can match responses to its queries.
    - **Flags:** A set of bits indicating:
        - Is this a query (0) or response (1)?
        - Is it a standard query? (Opcode)
        - Should the server attempt recursion (try to find the answer fully)? (RD - Recursion Desired, set in query)
        - Is recursion available at the server? (RA - Recursion Available, set in response)
        - Was there an error? (RCODE - Response Code, 0 means success)
        - And others (Authoritative Answer, Truncated, etc.)
    - **Counts:** Number of entries in the following sections (Question, Answer, Authority, Additional).
- **Question Section:** Contains the actual question being asked.
    
    - **QNAME (Query Name):** The hostname being looked up (e.g., `www.google.com`). This name is encoded in a special format (see below).
    - **QTYPE (Query Type):** What kind of record is being asked for? `1` (or `TYPE_A`) means an IPv4 address. Other types exist (AAAA for IPv6, MX for mail servers, etc.).
    - **QCLASS (Query Class):** Usually `1` (or `CLASS_IN`) for Internet addresses.
- **Answer Section (Mainly in Responses):** Contains the Resource Records (RRs) that answer the question. Each RR typically includes:
    
    - **NAME:** The hostname this answer pertains to (often uses compression, see below).
    - **TYPE:** The record type (e.g., `1` for 'A').
    - **CLASS:** The class (e.g., `1` for 'IN').
    - **TTL (Time To Live):** **Crucial for caching.** A 32-bit integer representing the number of _seconds_ the receiver should consider this RR valid.
    - **RDLENGTH:** The length (in bytes) of the RDATA field.
    - **RDATA (Resource Data):** The actual answer. For an 'A' record, this is the 4-byte IPv4 address.
- **Authority & Additional Sections (Mainly in Responses):** Contain RRs pointing to authoritative name servers or providing other helpful information. Our simple resolver focuses primarily on the Answer section.
    

**4. Special Encodings**

- **Hostname Encoding:** Domain names aren't stored as simple strings. They are broken into labels, each preceded by its length. `www.google.com` becomes `\x03www\x06google\x03com\x00`. The final `\x00` marks the end of the name. The `encode_dns_name` function did this.
- **Name Compression:** To reduce packet size, if a domain name (or part of it) has already appeared earlier in the packet, subsequent occurrences can be replaced with a pointer (a 2-byte value starting with `11` bits) that points back to the first occurrence. The `parse_dns_name` function needs to detect and follow these pointers.

**5. Transport Protocol (UDP)**

- DNS queries and responses are typically sent using **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** on **port 53**.
- UDP is connectionless and lightweight, making it fast for simple request-response protocols like DNS.
- It doesn't guarantee delivery or order, but for DNS, if a query is lost, the client usually just times out and tries again.
- If a DNS response is too large for UDP (historically &gt; 512 bytes, now often larger), it might be truncated, requiring the client to retry using TCP (which is connection-oriented and reliable but slower to set up). Our resolver only used UDP.

**6. DNS Caching (The Key Efficiency)**

- **Problem:** Constantly asking DNS servers for the same popular domain names (like https://www.google.com/search?q=google.com) is inefficient for both the client and the servers.
- **Solution:** Caching! Store the results locally for a short period.
- **How it Works (using the TTL):**
    1. When our resolver receives a DNS response with an IP address in the Answer section, it also extracts the **TTL** value for that record.
    2. It stores the hostname, its IP address(es), and calculates an `expiry_time` (current time + TTL seconds) in a local cache (our `DNS_CACHE` dictionary).
    3. **Crucially:** Before sending _any_ new DNS query, the resolver _first_ checks its cache:
        - Does an entry for this hostname exist?
        - If yes, has its `expiry_time` passed?
    4. If an entry exists and is still valid (not expired), the resolver uses the cached IP address directly – **no network request is needed!** This is a "cache hit".
    5. If no entry exists or the entry has expired ("cache miss" or "cache expired"), the resolver proceeds to send the query over the network, gets the response, and updates the cache with the new data and its TTL.

**In Summary:** The Python code manually constructed a binary DNS query packet according to protocol rules, sent it via a raw UDP socket, received the binary response, parsed the response (handling special name encoding and compression), extracted the IP address and the TTL from the answer section, and used the TTL to implement a local cache to avoid redundant network lookups. This was done using only basic Python modules (`socket`, `struct`, `random`, `time`) as required by the assignment, forcing a hands-on understanding of the DNS protocol.
