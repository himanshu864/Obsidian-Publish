This guide outlines the steps to set up an Ubuntu server for self-hosting, from initial installation to configuring network and SSH access.

## 0. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Server Hardware:** A computer with a 64-bit CPU architecture, at least 1 GB RAM, and 16 GB storage. It should have a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, and be connected to a stable 24/7 internet and power supply. This will serve as your dedicated server.
- **Remote Access Computer:** A separate computer (MacOS or Windows recommended) to perform remote actions via SSH.
- **Domain Name:** A public domain name (this will eventually be used for API access).
- **Bootable USB Drive:** A flash drive with at least 4 GB capacity to create a bootable Ubuntu installer.

## 1. Ubuntu Server Installation

Follow these steps to install Ubuntu Server on your designated hardware:

1. **Download Ubuntu Server:** Obtain the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of Ubuntu Server from the official website (e.g., `22.04.5 LTS amd64 Jammy Jellyfish`).
2. **Create Bootable USB:** Use a tool like Rufus to create a bootable USB drive with the downloaded ISO image.
3. **Data Backup (Optional but Recommended):** Perform a physical backup of all data on your server computer, as the installation process will erase all existing data.
4. **Boot from USB:** Insert the bootable USB drive into the server computer and restart it. You may need to access the BIOS/UEFI settings (often by pressing `F10` or `Del` during startup) to change the boot order and prioritize the USB drive.
5. **Install Ubuntu Server:**
    - Proceed with the Ubuntu Server installation.
    - **Crucial Step:** During disk setup, ensure you **uncheck** "Set up this disk as an LVM group" to avoid manual disk space allocation.
    - Accept all other default installation options.
6. **Initial Login & Upgrade:** After installation, log in with your created username and password, then upgrade your server:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

<Callout type="info">
Adjust Advanced BIOS settings if you encounter booting issues. The goal is for your server to boot automatically without manual intervention.
</Callout>

## 1.5. Fixing Network Issues (Optional: For Wi-Fi Connectivity)

If your server lacks Ethernet support and you're encountering Wi-Fi issues, follow these steps to install necessary network packages offline:

1. **Download Packages (on a computer with internet):**
    - Plug a flash drive into a computer with an internet connection.
    - Go to [packages.ubuntu.com](https://packages.ubuntu.com/ "null") and select your Ubuntu distribution (e.g., `jammy`).
    - Search for and download the following `.deb` packages to your flash drive:
        - `libbluetooth3`
        - `libndp0`
        - `libnm0`
        - `libteamdctl0`
        - `network-manager`
2. **Install Packages (on your Ubuntu server):**
    - Plug the flash drive into your running Ubuntu server.
    - Identify your flash drive's device name:
        ```bash
        lsblk
        ```
        (e.g., `sdb1` for SATA, `sda1` for NVMe).
		
    - Mount the flash drive:
        ```bash
        sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
        ```
        (Adjust `sdb1` if your drive/partition is different).
		
    - Navigate to the directory containing the downloaded `.deb` files:
        ```bash
        cd /mnt/yourfolder # e.g., cd /mnt/ubuntu-wifi
        ```
		
    - Install all downloaded `.deb` files:
        ```bash
        sudo dpkg -i *.deb
        ```
		
3. **Configure Wi-Fi using `nmtui`:**
    - Launch the NetworkManager Text User Interface:
        ```bash
        nmtui
        ```
        
    - Select "Activate a connection".
    - Choose your Wi-Fi network, enter the password, and select "OK".
    - Go back and select "Quit".
4. **Verify Connectivity:** Confirm internet access:
    
    ```bash
    ping google.com
    ```

<Callout type="warn">
After connecting, run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` again.
</Callout>
#### Optional: Reduce Boot Time

To prevent long boot times caused by "start job is running for wait for network to be configured," disable the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

## 2. Making Private IP Address Static

To ensure your server always has the same local IP address, configure it as static using NetworkManager's `nmtui`. Remove any existing `netplan` configurations if you've previously modified them.

1. **Access NetworkManager TUI:**
    ```bash
    sudo nmtui
    ```
    
2. **Edit Connection:** Select "Edit a connection" and choose your active Wi-Fi connection.
3. **Configure IPv4:**
    - Change "IPv4 CONFIGURATION" from "Automatic" to "Manual".
    - Select "Show" next to "Addresses".
    - **Add Address:** Select `<Add>` and enter your desired static IP address in CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.29.50/24`).
        - _Note:_ The first three octets of the static IP address must match your current IP address. Verify your current IP with `ip a` before setting a static one.
    - **Gateway:** Navigate to "Gateway" and enter your router's IP address (eg `192.168.29.1`).
    - **DNS Servers:** Navigate to "DNS servers" and enter your preferred DNS server(s), separated by a comma if multiple (e.g., `8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4`).
4. **Optional: Disable IPv6:** You can uncheck the IPv6 requirement to simplify the configuration if not needed.
5. **Save & Reconnect:**
    - Save your changes and exit the connection editor.
    - Navigate to `<Activate a connection>` and reconnect to your Wi-Fi network to apply the changes.
    - Save and exit `nmtui`.
6. **Verify Static IP & Internet:**
    - Confirm your new static IP address:
        ```bash
        ip a
        ```
		
    - Verify internet connectivity:
        ```bash
        ping google.com
        ```

## 3. Glorious SSH

Now that your server has a static IP and internet access, set up SSH for remote management. Ensure your server is fully updated and upgraded.

1. **Install SSH:** Install the SSH client and server on both your Ubuntu server and your personal computer:
    ```bash
    # On Ubuntu Server
    sudo apt install openssh-server -y
    
    # On your Personal Computer (if not already installed)
    sudo apt install ssh -y # For Linux/WSL, macOS usually has it
    ```
    
2. **Connect via SSH** (Password Authentication):
    - Ensure your personal computer is on the same local network as your server.
    - Open a terminal on your personal computer (preferably a Unix-like environment) and run:
        ```bash
        ssh your_server_username@your_static_ip
        # Example: ssh artoriax@192.168.29.50
        ```
        
    - Enter your server's password when prompted. You should now be connected.
        
3. **Configure SSH Key Authentication** (Recommended for Security & Convenience):
    - **Generate SSH Key** (if you don't have one): On your personal computer, follow [this GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent "null") to generate a new SSH key pair (e.g., `id_ed25519`).
    - **Copy Public Key:** Display your personal computer's public SSH key:
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
        ```
        
        Copy the entire output.
    - **Add Key to Server:** On your Ubuntu server (either directly or via the password-authenticated SSH session):
        - Create the `.ssh` directory if it doesn't exist:
            ```bash
            mkdir -p ~/.ssh
            chmod 700 ~/.ssh
            ```
            
        - Create or append your public key to the `authorized_keys` file:
            ```bash
            echo "PASTE_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
            chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
            ```
			
            Replace `"PASTE_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"` with the actual public key copied earlier.
    - **Test Key Authentication:** Exit the current SSH session (`exit`) and try connecting again from your personal computer. You should now be able to SSH in without a password.
4. **Disable Password Login:** (for enhanced security):
	- Once you have SSH key authentication working, disable password login for enhanced security.
	- Firstly make sure to generate SSH key (step 3) for all required devices via which you SSH.
	- Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
		- Change `PasswordAuthentication yes` to `PasswordAuthentication no`.
		- Reload SSH service: `sudo systemctl reload sshd`.

You have successfully set up your Ubuntu server for self-hosting with static IP and secure SSH access!

## 4. Making your IP Public - Cloudflare Tunneling

Refer: [video](https://youtu.be/BnWfbv7Fy-k?si=h2n-wD2aAmw_tmz7)

1. **Create a Cloudflare Account and Add Your Domain**
	- Sign up for a free Cloudflare account at `cloudflare.com`.
	- In your Cloudflare dashboard, click "Add a domain" and enter your domain name.
	- Select the free plan and continue.
2. **Update Your Domain's Nameservers**
	- Cloudflare will provide you with two nameservers.
	- Go to your domain registrar's DNS settings (where you purchased your domain).
	- Replace your existing nameservers with the ones provided by Cloudflare.
	- Propagation can take 5-10 minutes, up to 48 hours. Cloudflare will notify you when your site is active.
3. **Create a Permanent Tunnel in Cloudflare Zero Trust**
	- In your Cloudflare dashboard, navigate to "Zero Trust", then "Access" &gt; "Tunnels".
	- Click "Create a tunnel" and give it a name (e.g., "my-server-tunnel").
	- Click "Save tunnel". Cloudflare will provide a command to install the connector on your server, including a unique token. Copy and run this command (e.g., `sudo cloudflared service install YOUR_TUNNEL_TOKEN`).
	- Confirm the service is installed and click "Next" in the Cloudflare dashboard.
4. **Configure Public Hostnames for Your Tunnel**
	- Under "Public Hostnames", click "Add a public hostname".
	- Enter a **Subdomain** (e.g., `web`), select your **Domain**, choose **HTTP** as the **Service Type**, and enter your local service **URL** (e.g., `localhost:3000`).
	- Click "Save tunnel" or "Save hostname". You can add multiple hostnames to expose different services.
5. **(Optional) Configure SSL/TLS**
	- In your Cloudflare dashboard for your site, go to "SSL/TLS".
	- Set the encryption mode to "Full" for end-to-end encryption.
6. **Test Your Tunnel**
	- Open your configured public URL (e.g., `https://web.yourdomain.com`) in a browser.
	- It should now display content from your local service. (setup pm2)
	- If you encounter issues, try: waiting longer, using an incognito window, a different browser, or clearing DNS cache.

## 5. SSH into Home Server via Browser (Zero Trust)

This guide outlines how to securely access your home server via SSH through a web browser, leveraging Cloudflare Zero Trust without the need for port forwarding.

1. **Configure Public Hostname in Cloudflare Tunnel**
	- Navigate to your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, then to "Networks" and select your existing tunnel.
	- Add a new public hostname.
	- **Subdomain:** Choose a subdomain (e.g., `ssh`) and your primary domain.
	- **Type:** Select "SSH".
	- **URL:** Enter the local IP address of your server (`localhost:22`).
	- Save the configuration.
2. **Set Up an Access Policy (Application)**
	- An Access Policy is required to enable browser-based SSH.
	- Go to "Access" &gt; "Applications" and add a new "self-hosted" application.
	- **Application Name:** Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "SSH Access").
	- **Application Domain:** This _must_ match the subdomain and domain you set up for the tunnel (e.g., `ssh.yourdomain.com`).
	- Configure **Identity Providers** and **Session Duration** as desired. (default)
	- Set **Rules** for access (e.g., based on email or everyone).
	- **Crucial Step:** Under "Browser rendering," ensure you select "SSH".
	- Add the application.

Now you should be able to SSH into your home server via browser. Require email verification, user name and password. Can replace password with private key.

**SSH Key Authentication (Optional)**
- **Generate a new SSH key pair on your local machine:**
    - Use `ssh-keygen` and provide a unique filename (e.g., `Cloudflare_ssh_key`)
    - **Important:** Set a strong passphrase for your private key, as Cloudflare might require it
- **Add the public key to your server:**
    - Copy the contents of your public key file (e.g., `Cloudflare_ssh_key.pub`).
    - Paste it into the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on your server
- **Use the private key in the browser:**
    - When prompted by the browser SSH interface, select "private key"
    - Paste the _entire content_ of your **private key** file
    - Enter the passphrase you set for the private key
    - Submit to establish the SSH connection

This method provides a highly secure and convenient way to access your home server via SSH from any web browser, leveraging Cloudflare's robust security features.

Now you're ready and can deploy any application or service that you like on your personal machine. Boom!


I installed NextCloud and it's great. I'm also running web sockets on it, but the speed is horrible. This is still self hosted. I can run CRUD applications on it at decent pace. No problemo. This was fun.
