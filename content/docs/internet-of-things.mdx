- *Self‑Adaptation*: Systems adjust to varying conditions (e.g., network load).
- *Heterogeneity*: Different hardware/OS/protocols interoperate seamlessly.
- *Integrated Networking*: Devices collaborate toward a common goal.

**Benefits of IoT**
- Save time
- Efficient resource utilization
- Reduces human efforts and error

- **Fanout**: broadcast to all bound queues  
- **Topic**: pattern‑match (`*` single‑level, `#` multi‑level)  
- **Headers**: route by header attributes (`all` or `any`)

**Basic Workflow**  
1. Producer → **Exchange** (provides routing key)  
2. Exchange → bound **Queue(s)** (based on type & bindings)  
3. Consumer pulls (or is pushed) messages from Queue

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| **Syntactic** | Common message formats/schemas (e.g., JSON over MQTT)                                    |     |
| **Semantic**  | Shared vocabularies or ontologies so that “temp” on Device A means the same as “T” on B  |     |

    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);   // LED ON
    delay(1000);                  // wait 1000 ms
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);    // LED OFF
    delay(500);                   // wait 500 ms
  }
}

    ```
- **Reading Values**
    ```cpp
    float h = dht.readHumidity();     // %RH
    float t = dht.readTemperature();  // °C
    ```

> @@PLACEHOLDER32@@ must be called before any readings to initialize timing and data pins.

#### 6.2 Servo Motor Control

> @@PLACEHOLDER33@@ (i.e., @@PLACEHOLDER34@@) sets the shaft angle in degrees (0–180°).

## Assignment 6

### 1. Python for Embedded Development

- **Lightweight language**: Python’s interpreter and libraries are small enough to run on microcontrollers and SBCs like Raspberry Pi, making it popular for embedded apps.
- **Indentation**: Blocks are defined by consistent indentation (usually 4 spaces); no braces.

### 2. Common Python Operations

- **File I/O Modes**
    - `'r'`: read (error if file missing)
    - `'w'`: write, truncate existing content or create new
    - `'a'`: append to end
    - `'r+'`: read/write without truncating

### 5. Raspberry Pi Configuration & Camera

- **Configure camera**:
    ```bash
    sudo raspi-config
    ```

→ Enable camera interface → **Reboot** the Pi.

- **Basic Server Workflow**
    ```python
    sock = socket.socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.bind((host, port))
    sock.listen(backlog)      # Waits for incoming client connections
    conn, addr = sock.accept()
    ```
	
    - `.listen()` makes the socket wait for clients
- **UDP vs TCP Receive**
    - TCP: `data = sock.recv(bufsize)`
    - UDP: `data, addr = sock.recvfrom(bufsize)`

### 2. Plot Customization with Matplotlib

    - SDN → **Flow Table**
- **Time-outs in Flow Rules**
    - **Soft time-out**: idle timeout (removes rule if no matching packets seen)
    - **Hard time-out**: absolute timeout (removes rule after fixed time)
    - **Hard time-out ≥ Soft time-out**
- **Rule Placement Issue**
    - Deciding which switches get which flow rules is the **Flow Rule Placement** problem
- **APIs in SDN**
    - **Northbound**: controller → applications
    - **Southbound**: controller → switches

3. **Availability**: systems/data accessible when needed

#### Security Layers

- **Network-level**: firewalls, VPNs
- **Host-level**: HIDS/HIPS on VMs

    1. **Generation** (sensors, meters)
    2. **Acquisition** (gateways, edge nodes)
    3. **Storage** (time-series DBs, data lakes)
    4. **Analysis** (predictive analytics, dashboards) .
- **Unstructured data**: ~ **80%** of world’s data (logs, images, sensor blobs) – drives need for NoSQL and distributed file systems .
- **SQL vs NoSQL**: SQL excels at **structured** (tabular) data; use NoSQL for flexible schemas and unstructured streams.

### 6. Intelligent Transport System (ITS)

- **Connectivity modes**: V2V, V2S (sensors), V2I (infrastructure), but **not** typically V2H (home) in ITS scope .

## Assignment 12

### 1. Qualitative vs Quantitative

- **Qualitative analysis**: examination of non-numerical data (e.g., interviews, observations).
- **Quantitative analysis**: statistical treatment of numerical data.

### 2. Statistical Techniques

- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**
    - Tests mean differences **across ≥2 groups** by comparing between-group to within-group variance.
    - **Assumptions**:
        1. Homogeneity of variances
        2. Normally distributed response
        3. Independence of observations
    - **Types**: One-way, Two-way, K-way .
- **Regression Analysis**
    - Models relationship: predicts **dependent** variable from one/more **independent** variables .
- **ARIMA**
    - Time-series forecasting (uses AutoRegressive & Moving Average components + differencing).
- **Effect Size**
    - Standardized **mean** difference between groups; complements p-values by quantifying magnitude .

### 3. Dispersion Measures

- **Range**: Max – Min
- **Variance**: Average squared deviation from the mean .

### 4. IoT Analytics Approaches

- **In-place processing**: Data is processed **on the device** (edge analytics), reducing latency and bandwidth use .
- **Network-based**: Data sent to cloud/fog for processing.

### 5. Case Study: AgriSens Architecture

- **Three logical layers**:
    1. **Perception** (sensors: soil moisture, water level)
    2. **Processing** (edge nodes, gateways)
    3. **Application** (dashboards, alerts) .
- **Real-time monitoring**: Soil moisture readings streamed to dashboard for instant irrigation control .

### 6. Smart Healthcare Data Aggregator

- Known as **LPU** (Local Processing Unit) — collects & pre-processes patient sensor data before cloud uplink .
- **AmbuSense**: Privacy-aware system with patient identity masking built in .

### 7. Wearable AI Use-Case

- **Fall detection**: Handheld/activity-monitoring device uses onboard AI on accelerometer/gyroscope streams to detect sudden drops .

### 8. Motion Sensing

- **Gyroscope**: Detects device **tilt/rotation** (e.g., 15° tilt) .
- **Accelerometer**: Measures linear acceleration; can infer orientation but less precise for angular velocity.
