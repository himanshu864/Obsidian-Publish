- Can't store data on front-end. Also sensitive information and stuff. Need backend

- Connect to a database via HTTP Requests (API)

# Fetch to GET
---
React has a built-in method *fetch(' ')* which is used to retrieve data from backend API.

- Takes a URL as a string and returns a promise.
- The response is typically in JSON format.
 - Once the data is fetched, you can use it to update the state in your React components.

```jsx
    fetch("http://localhost:3000/")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((resData) =>  setAvailablePlaces(resData.places));
```

## Async Await in React

- async/await cannot be directly used in JSX due to its syntax.
- However, you can use async/await inside regular JavaScript functions and call those functions within your React components.

Also useEffect to avoid infinite loops.

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function AvailablePlaces({ onSelectPlace }) {
  const [availablePlaces, setAvailablePlaces] = useState([]);

  const fetchPlaces = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/places");
    const resData = await response.json();
    setAvailablePlaces(resData.places);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchPlaces();
  }, []);

  return (
	  // jsx
  );
}
```

- Can also use extra states to update fetching progress and try-catch to handle Errors

# Fetch to Update
---
Fetch method also supports a second parameter *options*. Where we can configure HTTP Request as we want.

```jsx
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:3000/user-places", {
    method: "PUT",
    body: JSON.stringify({ places }),
    headers: {
	    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
});
```

Now we can perform any action with an API.

### Optimistic Update

It's necessary to reflect changes and handle errors with dealing with API.
We might consider updating UI as soon as user requests and then hope for a positive response.
Otherwise we simple roll back to initial State and show some kind of error message.
That's Optimistic I'd say.
