# UNIT 1

## Indian Energy Scenario

- Per capita energy consumption in India is low compared to developed countries (4% of USA, 20% of world average).
- Energy demand expected to increase over next 10-15 years.
- Coal remains dominant fuel for power generation.

**Primary Energy Mix (≈ 2023–24)**
* **Coal:** \~55 % (dominant source for electricity)
* **Oil & Gas:** \~30 % (transport, industry, residential)
* **Renewables:** \~13 % (solar, wind, small hydro, biomass)
* **Nuclear & Hydro:** \~2 % each
	
**Key Drivers & Challenges**
* Rapid economic growth → rising electricity demand (≈ 6 % / year)
* Energy security → domestic coal + diversified imports
* Emissions & climate goals → shift to renewables, cleaner coal tech

## Indian Coals

### Coal in India

- India has world's 4th largest coal reserves
- Coal accounts for 55% of country's energy needs
- Gondwana coal makes up 98% of total reserves and 99% of production
- Indigenous coal production needs expansion to meet future demand

### Formation & Types

* **Origin:** Terrestrial plant matter buried in swamps → peat → lignite → sub-bituminous → bituminous → anthracite (highest rank).
* **Indian Coal Zones:**
			* **Jharia, Raniganj, Bokaro:** High-rank bituminous (coking)
	* **Talcher, Neyveli:** Lignite, sub-bituminous (non-coking)

## Beneficiation (Coal Washing)

* **Purpose:** Remove inert ash and impurities → raise heating value, reduce emissions.
* **Methods:**
	* **Gravity Separation:** Dense medium cyclone, jigs.
	* **Froth Flotation:** For fine-sized coal.
	* **Magnetic Separation:** Removes iron-bearing gangue.
* **Benefits:**
	* Lower ash → fewer boiler fouling & slagging problems
	* Reduced transport cost per unit energy
	* Less particulate emissions (fly ash, bottom ash)

## Heating Value Calculation

* **Gross Calorific Value (GCV):**

* **Approximate Formula (Dulong’s):** Estimate heating value from the elemental composition. (carbon, hydrogen, sulfur, and ash content)

  where C, H, O, S are mass % of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur.
* **Example:**
  Coal with C = 55 %, H = 4 %, O = 20 %, S = 1 %

| **Volatility**     | Low to medium                                                   | High                                 |
| **Moister**        | Low to medium                                                   | High                                 |

## Coal Gasification

- Process of producing syngas (CO, H2, CO2, CH4).
- Involves blowing coal with oxygen and steam under heat and pressure.
- Used for in-situ gasification and in coal refineries.
* **Reactions:**
	* C + O₂ → CO₂
	* C + ½O₂ → CO
	* C + H₂O → CO + H₂
- **Types of Gasifiers:**

	- **Fluidized-Bed Gasifiers:** Offer better mixing, suitable for low-grade coal.
	- **Entrained-Flow Gasifiers:** Operate at very high temperatures and are used for fine coal particles.
- **Syngas Composition:** Mainly consists of CO, H₂, CO₂, and CH₄, which can be used for power generation or chemical synthesis.
* **Advantages & Challenges:**
	* ✔️ Lower SOₓ/NOₓ emissions than direct combustion
	* ✔️ Produces a clean, versatile fuel stream
	* ❌ High capital cost; tar handling; ash slagging

**Purpose:** Collect, transport, and dispose of ash produced by coal combustion—both bottom ash (clinker) and fly ash.

![Pasted image 20250509005611.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Pasted%20image%2020250509005611.png)
### Types of Ash

| Ash Type           | Origin                                     | Particle Size |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **Bottom Ash**     | Coarser residues falling to furnace hearth | \~10 – 50 mm  |
| **Fly Ash**        | Fine particles carried with flue gas       | &lt; 100 μm      |
| **Economizer Ash** | Very fine particles from heat exchangers   | &lt; 5 μm        |

### Bottom Ash Handling

1. **Grate/Boiler Hopper**
	* Collects the heavy particles under the furnace.
2. **Ash Crushers / Breakers**
	* Reduce clinkers to manageable size for conveying.
3. **Hydraulic (Wet) System**
	* **Water-Cooled Conveyor Belt:** Bottom ash quenched with water → sluiced into a water-filled sump.
	* **Dewatering Screen/Classifier:** Separates water, discharges semi-dry ash to silo.
4. **Mechanical (Dry) System**
	* **Belt or Screw Conveyor:** Directly transports cooled ash.
	* **Air-Cooled Hopper & Conveyor:** Minimizes water use; ash remains dry.

### Fly Ash Handling

1. **Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) / Baghouse**
	* Captures &gt; 99 % of fly ash from flue gas.
2. **Fly Ash Silo / Hopper**
	* Intermittent storage under the ESP outlets.
3. **Pneumatic Conveying**
	* **Dense-Phase (Plug Flow):** Low velocity, high pressure → less pipe wear.
	* **Lean-Phase (Dilute Flow):** High velocity, lower pressure → simpler but more abrasion.
4. **Ash Sluicing (Wet)**
	* **Hydraulic Ash Transport:** Mix ash with water (30–40 % solids) → slurry pumped to ash pond or dewatering plant.

### Disposal & Utilization

* **Ash Ponds / Dams:** Impoundment of slurry; risk of seepage and environmental impact.
* **Dry Ash Landfill:** Requires engineered liners; preferred for fly ash reuse.
* **Beneficiation & Utilization:**
	* **Cement & Concrete:** Fly ash as pozzolanic material.
	* **Bricks & Blocks:** Bottom ash aggregates.
	* **Road Construction:** Sub-base material.

### Difficulties in Ash Handling

1. **High Temperature & Abrasion**
	* Hot bottom ash (&gt;550 °C) wears equipment; fine fly ash erodes pipes and valves.
2. **Slurry Management**
	* Balancing ash–water slurry density to avoid blockages and high pumping costs.
3. **Dust Emissions**
	* Fugitive PM₂.₅/PM₁₀ at transfer points requires enclosed conveyors or bag filters.
4. **Corrosion**
	* Wet ash leachates (sulfates/chlorides) corrode pumps, pipes, and linings.
5. **Pond Stability & Land Use**
	* Ash pond siltation, dam integrity monitoring, and land consumption for storage.
6. **Variable Ash Quality**
	* Fluctuating ash composition (carbon/chemistry) clogs hoppers and complicates reuse.
7. **Regulatory Compliance**
	* Controlling leachate, meeting PM and water-quality standards drives costs.

## Binary Vapor Cycles

- **Definition:** Two‐stage Rankine cycle using two different working fluids, each optimized for a part of the heat‐source temperature range.
- **Operation:**
    1. **High‐Temperature Loop:** Fluid A (e.g. ammonia) vaporizes at high source temperature → drives a turbine → rejects heat at intermediate temperature.
    2. **Low‐Temperature Loop:** Fluid B (e.g. water/steam) picks up that rejected heat → vaporizes → drives a second turbine → rejects to condenser.
- **Advantages:**

## Nuclear Power Plant and Types

1. **Fission Reaction**
	* A neutron hits a uranium‑235 nucleus → it splits into two smaller nuclei + 2–3 neutrons + \~200 MeV of heat.
	* Those extra neutrons go on to split more nuclei (chain reaction), as long as enough fuel and neutrons remain.
2. **Key Components & Flow**
	* **Fuel Rods:** Ceramic UO₂ pellets in long metal tubes (“fuel assemblies”).
	* **Moderator:** Usually light water; slows neutrons so fission stays efficient.
	* **Control Rods:** Made of boron or cadmium; inserted to soak up neutrons (slows/stops fission).
	* **Coolant Loop:** Hot water (or liquid sodium) circulates through the core, picks up heat, and carries it away.
	* **Steam Side (PWR vs BWR):**
		* **PWR:** Coolant stays liquid under \~155 bar. It flows through a **steam generator** to boil water in a separate loop → steam spins the turbine.
		* **BWR:** Coolant boils right inside the reactor vessel at \~70 bar. That steam, after moisture separation, goes straight to the turbine.
	* **Containment Building:** Thick concrete/steel “shell” around the reactor vessel to trap any radioactive leaks.
3. **Safety & Shutdown**
	* **Scram (Emergency Shutdown):** All control rods slam in within seconds.
	* **Emergency Core Cooling:** Backup pumps or gravity‑fed water flood the core if pressure or flow drops.
	* **Containment Spray:** Cools and filters any gases before venting.

## Control in Nuclear Power Plants

### A. Principles of Reactivity Control

- **Reactivity:** measure of how far the chain reaction is from being self-sustaining (k = 1).
- **Goal:** keep k ≈ 1 for steady power; adjust when starting, stopping, or changing load.

### B. Main Control Mechanisms

| Method                    | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Control Rods**          | Neutron-absorbing rods (Boron carbide, Ag–In–Cd alloys) inserted/withdrawn to “soak up” excess neutrons. Fast response; primary shutdown device. |
| **Chemical Shim (Boron)** | Soluble boric acid in PWR primary coolant. Vary concentration to fine-tune long-term reactivity.                                                 |
| **Moderator Temperature** | In PWRs/BWRs: hotter moderator = lower density = fewer slow neutrons = negative feedback (“temp. coefficient”). Helps stabilize power.           |
| **Coolant Flow Rate**     | In BWRs: changing flow alters void fraction (steam bubbles) and thus neutron moderation; used for load following.                                |
| **Burnable Poisons**      | Materials (e.g. gadolinium) in fuel assemblies that absorb excess neutrons early in life, then “burn away” to flatten reactivity over cycle.     |

### C. Safety & Protection Systems

1. **Reactor Protection System (RPS)**
    - Hardwired logic that scrams (fully inserts rods) if parameters exceed safe limits (e.g. high power, pressure, temperature).
2. **Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS)**
    - Injects high-pressure water or alternative coolant if a loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) is detected.
3. **Automatic Control & Instrumentation**
    - Digital/analog controls manage rod positions, boron addition, flow control, and trip logic.
4. **Xenon Poisoning Management**
    - Xenon-135 builds up after power changes, absorbing neutrons. Operators plan maneuvers (and boron adjustments) to avoid “iodine pit” transients.

## Hydroelectric Power Plant

### 1. Basics of Hydroelectric Power

![Screenshot 2025-05-08 at 5.12.11 PM.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202025-05-08%20at%205.12.11%20PM.png)

**Principle:**  
Convert the potential and kinetic energy of water into electricity via turbines and generators.

**Key Components:**

1. **Dam or Intake Structure**
    - Creates a head (height difference) or diverts flow.
2. **Reservoir (for storage plants)**
    - Stores water; smooths out seasonality.
3. **Penstock**
    - Closed pipe conveying water from intake to turbine.
4. **Turbine**
    - Water’s energy spins runner blades (types vary by head & flow).
5. **Generator**
    - Coupled to the turbine shaft; produces AC power.
6. **Tailrace**
    - Discharges water back to the river downstream.
7. **Control Gates & Valves**
    - Regulate flow and protect equipment.
8. **Switchyard / Transformer**
    - Steps up voltage for transmission.

### 2. Classification by Plant Layout

* **Storage (Reservoir):** Big dam creates lake; release water on demand. High capital cost.
* **Run‑of‑River:** Little storage—power follows river flow hour‑to‑hour. Variable output.
* **Pumped‑Storage:** Two reservoirs at different elevations—pump up at night, generate in day. Responsive to load changes but low efficiency.

### 3. Classification by Hydraulic Head

Hydraulic head = the vertical drop (m) between intake and turbine.

| Head Category   | Head Range | Typical Turbine(s)  | Notes                                                                                                                                                     |

| **High Head**   | &gt; 300 m    | Pelton wheel        | • Impulse turbine&lt;br&gt;• Ideal for steep mountainous sites where you can get a lot of drop over a short distance.                                           |
| **Medium Head** | 30–300 m   | Francis turbine     | • Reaction/mixed-flow turbine&lt;br&gt;• Very versatile—most common in large conventional plants.                                                               |
| **Low Head**    | &lt; 30 m     | Kaplan or Propeller | • Axial-flow reaction turbines&lt;br&gt;• Suited to large flow rates but small elevation changes (e.g., low-lying rivers).&lt;br&gt;• Adjustable blades; hence loads. |

### 4. Plant Operation & Control

1. **Flow Regulation**
    - Guide vanes or wicket gates adjust flow rate.
2. **Speed Control**
    - Governor maintains generator speed (50/60 Hz).
3. **Load Balancing**
    - Run-of-river adjusts to available flow.
    - Reservoir and pumped storage can follow load curves.
4. **Safety Systems**
    - Surge tanks relieve water hammer.
    - Relief valves protect penstock integrity.

### 5. Advantages & Disadvantages

| Advantages                            | Disadvantages                                     |

## Tidal Power Plant

Tidal power harnesses the energy from natural rise and fall of ocean tides to generate electricity. It’s highly predictable (governed by moon and sun) and environmentally clean once built.

### 1. Working Principle

1. **Tidal Range (Head):** Difference in water level between high tide and low tide.
2. **Flow of Water:** As tide rises and falls, water is allowed to flow through turbines.
3. **Energy Conversion:** Kinetic or potential energy of moving water spins turbines, which drive generators to produce AC power.

### 2. Main Types

| Type                    | Key Feature                                                                                           |

| **Tidal Barrage**       | Dam-like structure (barrage) across an estuary. Turbines operate on both incoming and outgoing tides. |
| **Tidal Lagoon**        | Enclosed “ring” of sea walls built into a bay or coastline. Functions like a mini-barrage.            |
| **Tidal Stream**        | Underwater horizontal-axis turbines placed directly in strong tidal currents (no dam).                |
| **Dynamic Tidal Power** | Straight dam ("T-shape") extending from coast; exploits phase differences along its length.           |
| **Tidal Kite / AUV**    | Underwater “kite” or glider tethered to seabed; moves in a figure-8 to capture energy.                |

### 3. Operation Modes

* **Ebb Generation:** Water stored at high tide, then released through turbines as tide falls.
* **Flood Generation:** Turbines turn as sea flows in at rising tide.
* **Two-Way Generation:** Uses both ebb and flood, doubling energy yield (requires reversible turbines).
* **Pumped Enhancement:** Some lagoons pump water back at low tide, increasing head for the next cycle (similar to pumped-storage).

## Open-Cycle vs. Closed-Cycle Power Plants

### A. Definitions

**Open-Cycle**

* **Process:** Working fluid (air, fuel, combustion gases) passes once through the system and is then exhausted (e.g. traditional gas turbines, diesel engines).
* **Example Plants:**
	* Simple-cycle gas turbine
	* Diesel‐engine generator
	
**Closed-Cycle**

* **Process:** A sealed working fluid (e.g. helium, CO₂, steam, organic fluids) is continuously circulated in a loop between heat‐addition, expansion (turbine), heat rejection, and compression stages.
* **Example Plants:**
	* Closed-cycle gas turbine (using inert gas)
	* Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) engines
	* Closed-steam Rankine loops in nuclear or solar thermal plants

### B. Key Differences

| Aspect                      | Open-Cycle                                               | Closed-Cycle                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Fluid**           | Fresh intake each cycle; exhaust is vented               | Same fluid recirculates; isolated from atmosphere                                                             |
| **Thermal Efficiency**      | Limited by single expansion → \~30–40 % (simple Brayton) | Can combine multiple stages (reheat, regeneration) → often 40–60 % or more                                    |
| **Emissions Control**       | Must treat exhaust directly (combustion by-products)     | Sealed fluid avoids direct combustion emissions; only heat exchangers interact with combustion or heat source |
| **Heat Source Flexibility** | Predominantly combustion of fuel                         | Can use any external heat: solar, nuclear, geothermal, biomass                                                |
| **Complexity & Cost**       | Simpler plant layout; lower capital cost                 | More equipment (recirculation pumps/compressors, heat exchangers) → higher initial cost                       |
| **Startup & Transients**    | Quick: no need to pressurize loop                        | Slower: loop must warm up/pressurize before production                                                        |
| **Maintenance**             | Easier—components are exposed                            | Requires leak-tight seals and more complex heat‐exchanger maintenance                                         |

### C. When to Use Which

* **Open-Cycle**
	* Peaking and backup power (fast start, modular).
	* Sites where fuel combustion and exhaust treatment are acceptable.
* **Closed-Cycle**
	* When you need high efficiency and can supply a steady external heat source (e.g. nuclear, solar thermal, waste-heat).
	* Environments where emissions must be fully contained (offshore, enclosed facilities).

# NUMERICALS

### Calculate efficiency, work output, or heat rates for given steam cycle parameters (numerical problem).

##### **Basic Theory**

1. **Isentropic Expansion:**
    - When steam expands in the turbine, the process is often assumed to be isentropic (i.e., the entropy remains constant).
    - This helps us find the quality of steam (the ratio of vapor to total mass) at the turbine exit using the steam table values.

![Screenshot 2025-03-05 at 12.51.12 PM.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202025-03-05%20at%2012.51.12%20PM.png)

##### **Key Formulas and Their Meanings**

**Turbine Work Output:**
- **Formula:**

- **Explanation:**
	$h_1$ is the enthalpy of steam at the turbine inlet, and $h_2$ is the enthalpy at the turbine exit. Their difference represents the energy converted to work.

**Heat Input:**
- **Formula:**

- **Explanation:**
	$h_1$ is the steam enthalpy coming out of the boiler, and $h_{\text{feedwater}}$ is the enthalpy of water entering the boiler. This difference is the energy added to the cycle.

**Thermal Efficiency:**
- **Formula:**

- **Explanation:**
	The efficiency is the ratio of the net work output (usually taken as the turbine work when pump work is negligible) to the heat input.

**Heat Rate:**
- **Formula:**


- **Explanation:**
	This shows how much heat energy is required to produce one unit of electrical energy. The multiplication by 3600 converts the units from kJ per kJ to kJ per kWh.

**Determining Steam Quality (for Isentropic Expansion):**
- **Formula:**

- **Explanation:**
	Here, $s_1$ is the entropy at the turbine inlet, $s_f$ and $s_g$ are the entropies of the saturated liquid and vapor at the turbine exit pressure, and $x$ is the steam quality (fraction of vapor). Once $x$ is known, you can find $h_2$ using:


##### **Sample Problem**

A simple Rankine cycle operates under the following conditions:

- **Boiler (State 1):** Steam is generated at 10 MPa and 600°C.
- **Turbine Exit (State 2):** Steam expands isentropically to 0.1 MPa.
- **Assumption:** Pump work is negligible.

Using approximate steam table data:

- **At 10 MPa and 600°C:**
    - $h_1 \approx 3580\ \text{kJ/kg}$
    - $s_1 \approx 6.50\ \text{kJ/kg·K}$
- **At 0.1 MPa (saturated conditions):**
    - Saturated liquid enthalpy, $h_f \approx 417\ \text{kJ/kg}$
    - Saturated vapor enthalpy, $h_g \approx 2584\ \text{kJ/kg}$
    - Saturated liquid entropy, $s_f \approx 1.10\ \text{kJ/kg·K}$
    - Saturated vapor entropy, $s_g \approx 7.50\ \text{kJ/kg·K}$

**Tasks:**

1. Determine the turbine exit enthalpy $h_2$.
2. Calculate the net work output per kg of steam.
3. Compute the thermal efficiency of the cycle.
4. Determine the heat rate (in kJ/kWh).

##### **Step-by-Step Solution**

**1. Turbine Expansion (State 1 to State 2)**

Since the expansion is isentropic:


At 0.1 MPa, let the quality of the steam be $x$. Then:


Solving for $x$:


Now, determine the enthalpy at turbine exit $h_2$:

Substitute the values:



**2. Turbine Work Output**

Turbine work per kg of steam is given by:


**3. Heat Input and Thermal Efficiency**

Assuming the feedwater enters the boiler at nearly the condensate condition $h \approx 417\ \text{kJ/kg}$, the heat input is:


Thermal efficiency $\eta$ is:


**4. Heat Rate**

Heat rate is the amount of heat input required per unit of work output. In kJ per kWh, it is calculated as:


##### **Result**

- **Turbine Exit Enthalpy $h_2$:** ~2245 kJ/kg
- **Net Work Output:** ~1335 kJ/kg
- **Thermal Efficiency:** ~42.2%
- **Heat Rate:** ~8532 kJ/kWh
