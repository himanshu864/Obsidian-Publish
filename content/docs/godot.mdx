# How Godot Works

- **Node**: A building block of a game (e.g., Sprite, TileMap, Camera, Physics, etc).
- **Scene**: A collection of nodes that function as a unit (e.g., a player, level, or UI).
- **Nesting**: Scenes can be made up of multiple nodes and nested inside other scenes.
- **Scene Tree**: A hierarchy where nodes are structured, with changes in one scene reflecting across all instances in the game.

---
# Player 1.0

- Create the game root scene:
	- Add Root Node 2D and save renamed Game root scene in its directory.
- Set up player scene:
	- Create new scene with node `cmd + A` named `CharacterBody2D`.
	- Add another node named `AnimatedSprite2D` to add graphics to that character.
	- On the right, select `Sprite Frames` under Animation tab of inspector, and add a new sprite frame.
	- Add new frames to sprite sheet, resize to match your assets, and add sequentially.
	- Change texture to nearest inside project settings for crisp pixel art.
	- Adjust animation name, fps, autoplay and position.
	- Since physics nodes need shape to interact with objects, add `CollisionShape2D` node with circle shape under characterBody2D.
	- Save `player` scene and drag to `game` scene.
- Integrate player into game:
	- Add a `Camera2D` node to `game` scene and adjust zoom. Build to see progress.
	- Add default script to `player` scene.

Building will make player fall off due to no floor collision. Add a `StaticBody2D` node with `WorldBoundaryShape2D` inside game script. Now you can move around with arrow keys and jump with space.

---
# World Building 1.0

We can start by deleting the temporary `StaticBody2D` group and use a `TileMap` node.

![Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 3.45.51 PM.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/himanshu864/DevObs/refs/heads/main/Assets/Screenshot%202025-02-13%20at%203.45.51%20PM.png)

**TileSet**: Collection of tiles to paint from.
**TileMap**: Node used to paint tiles into our game.

- Select TileSet on inspector tab of TileMap. Adjust size.
- Drag tile asset to TileSet option at the bottom and select yes.
- Setup TileSet by erase wrong tiles and selecting one big tile by holding `shift`.

Now you can create an entire map for your game. But no collision.

- Add a new element in physics layer under TileSet in inspector tab. Now add physics to tiles by going to TileSet (bottom) and painting tiles with physics layer 0.
- `C` to clear physics. `F` to fill. Custom hit box per tile by cropping.

Now player can interact with the environment. But camera isn't following him.

Add camera to as a child of player node and smoothen it.

---
# Platform 1.0

**Static Platforms**

- Create a new scene with `AnimatableBody2D` as the root node.
- Add a `Sprite2D` node as a child.
- Drag the platform sprite into the Texture property of the Sprite2D.
- Enable "Region" in the Sprite2D properties and adjust the region to show only one platform tile.
- Add a `CollisionShape2D` node and set its shape to a rectangle matching the platform's size. Also able "One way collision" if you wanna jump on it from below.
- Rename the root node to "Platform" and save the scene.
- Instance the platform in your main scene as needed.

**Moving Platforms**

- Select an instanced platform in your main scene.
- Add an `AnimationPlayer` node as a child of the platform.
- Create a new animation named "move" at bottom.
- Create a key frame for Platform 2 at position under transition tab.
- Set the animation length (e.g., 2 seconds).
- Create keyframe at 1s after adjusting the platform's position.
- Enable "Loop" mode in the AnimationPlayer.
- Set "Autoplay" to "move" in the AnimationPlayer properties.

---
# Pickups

**Coin Pickup**

- Create a new scene with `Area2D` as the root node. (to only *detect* if colliding)
- Add an `AnimatedSprite2D` node as a child.
- Create new SpriteFrames for the coin animation.
- Add frames from the coin sprite sheet to create the animation.
- Set the animation to autoplay and adjust the speed as needed.
- Add a `CollisionShape2D` node and set its shape to a circle.
- Rename the root node to "Coin" and save the scene.
- Create a script for the Coin scene
- Delete default boilerplate and select node tab inside coin script. Connect `on_body_entered()` to detect coins colliding with any body (including moving platforms).
- Set player to 2nd physics layer and coin to 2nd mask, to only detect player and coin collision.
- Schedule collided node for deletion using `queue_free()`.

```gdscript
extends Area2D

func _on_body_entered(body: Node2D) -> void:
	queue_free() # coins +1
```

---
# Dying 1.0

**Death Cam**

- Set a below limit to `Camera2D` to prevent camera from following player to its death.

**Kill Zone**

- Create a new scene with `Area2D` as the root node.
- Add a `CollisionShape2D` node and set its shape to world boundary to cover the area where the player should die (e.g., bottom of the screen). (only in game script)
- Rename the root node to "KillZone" and save the scene.
- Set it's mask to 2nd second to detect player collision.
- Create a script for the KillZone with `on_body_entered()`:
- Add a `Timer` to restart game after delay. Drag and drop with node to script while pressing `cmd`. Finally connect to `time_out` signal. Can adjust wait time.

```gdscript
extends Area2D

@onready var timer: Timer = $$Timer

func _on_body_entered(body: Node2D) -> void:
	print("YOU DIED!")
	timer.start()

func _on_timer_timeout() -> void:
	get_tree().reload_current_scene()
```

---
# World Building 2.0

- Clean up scene tree by adding empty node named coins and platforms.
- Add a new background layer inside inspection tab of `TileMap` and fill up as you desire.

---
# General Scripting Stuff

- `delta`: It is the amount of time gone by since the last frame. Used for frame-rate independent physics calculations.
- `Input.is_action_just_pressed()`: Checks if an input action was just pressed this frame.
- `Input.is_action_pressed()`: Checks if an input action is being held down (hold).
- `Input.get_axis()`: Returns a value between -1 and 1 based on the input of two opposite actions.
- `move_toward(curr value, target value, max speed)`: Gradually changes a value towards a target at a fixed rate.
- `move_and_slide()`: Applies current `velocity` to character's `position` including collisions.
- **Signals** are used for event driven programming.
- `func _ready()` : only called when node enters scene tree for first time.
- `func _process()`: called every frames. (game loop). Variable.
- `func _physics_process()` runs at a constant 60 fps to avoid janky physics behaviour.

---
# Enemy

- Create a new scene with `Node2D` as the root node named "Slime".
- Add the following child nodes:
	- `AnimatedSprite2D`: For enemy graphics (add sprite sheet and animate)
	- `Killzone`: Drag this scene for death on collision.
		- `CollisionShape2D`: For physics interactions (rectangle).
	- `RayCastLeft` and `RayCastRight`: To detect walls or edges.
- Save the scene as `slime.tscn`.

**Enemy Behavior Script**:

- Attach a script to the enemy node.
- Add constant speed w.r.t delta to character's position.
- Drag (and drop with holding `cmd`) both ray casts to slime script to reverse direction when hitting walls.
- Also drag `AnimationSprite2D` to script to update graphics to face correct direction.

```gdscript
extends Node2D

const SPEED = 60

var direction = 1

@onready var ray_cast_left: RayCast2D =$$RayCastLeft
@onready var ray_cast_right: RayCast2D = $$RayCastRight
@onready var animated_sprite: AnimatedSprite2D =$$AnimatedSprite2D

# Called every frame.
# 'delta' is used for frame-rate independent calculations
func _process(delta: float) -> void:
	if ray_cast_left.is_colliding():
		direction = 1
		animated_sprite.flip_h = false
	if ray_cast_right.is_colliding():
		direction = -1
		animated_sprite.flip_h = true
		
	position.x += SPEED * direction * delta
```

---
# Dying 2.0

- Slow down time using `Engine.time_scale = 0.5` inside KillZone script.
- Remove the players collision shape and make him jump like Mario.
- KillZone's function `on_body_entered(body)` gives direct access to our player.

```gdscript
extends Area2D

@onready var timer: Timer = $$Timer

func _on_body_entered(body: Node2D) -> void:
	print("YOU DIED!")
	Engine.time_scale = 0.6 # Slow down time
	body.get_node("CollisionShape2D").queue_free() # rmv player collision
	body.velocity.y = body.JUMP_VELOCITY # make player jump
	timer.start()
%%  %%
func _on_timer_timeout() -> void:
	Engine.time_scale = 1 # revert back time
	get_tree().reload_current_scene() # restart game
```

---
# Player 2.0

**Actions**: Create keybindings to perform certain action.

- Open Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Input Map.
- Add action names with keybinding(s).
- Modify player script accordingly.

Update player graphics to face the direction we're moving.

```gdscript
	var direction := Input.get_axis("move_left", "move_right")

	# Flip sprite
	if direction > 0:
		animated_sprite.flip_h = false
	elif direction < 0:
		animated_sprite.flip_h = true
```

**Better Animation**

- Add new running, jump and fall animations to player.
- Add frames from sprite sheet.
- Modify player script.
```gdscript
	if not is_on_floor():
		if velocity.y < 0:
			animated_sprite.play("jump")
		else:
			animated_sprite.play("fall")
	else:
		if velocity.x == 0:
			animated_sprite.play("idle")
		else:
			animated_sprite.play("run")
```

# Text

- Use `Label` node for displaying text on screen
- Set text property, position, and customize font (use Pixel font for retro look)
- Will display over background and player.

---
# Score

- Create a node named `GameMananger` as first child of Game scene.
- Add following script to it with scoring system to add points.

```gdscript
extends Node

var score = 0

func add_point():
	score += 1
	print(score)
```

- Refer this function inside coins script after marking Game Manager as unique node `%`. Works because in the same scene.

```gdscript
extends Area2D

@onready var game_manager = %GameManager

func _on_body_entered(_body: Node2D) -> void:
	game_manager.add_point()
	queue_free() # coins 1+
```

- Display score using a `Label` node as a child of Game Manager.
- Update `ScoreLabel` text whenever score changes from game manager script.

```gdscript
extends Node

@onready var score_label: Label =$$ScoreLabel

var score = 0

func add_point():
	score += 1
	score_label.text = "Score: " + str(score)
```

---
# Audio

- Add `AudioStreamPlayer2D` for background music.
- Import music, adjust, autoplay, loop and stuff.
- Adjust volume by adding Buses at Audio tab at bottom.

Now music is replay every the game restarts. To remedy that, we can use **autoloads**.

- Drag and drop Music nodes into scenes folder, and save.
- Add that scene to Project &gt; Project Settings &gt; Globals &gt; Autoload.

Now music keeps playing. How to add pickup music for coins? Cool shit without coding, only animation keyframes. I'm not documenting that.

- Add `AnimationPlayer` and follow the [video](https://youtu.be/LOhfqjmasi0?si=R-Dl5jXZGaLPquiG) from 1:11:30

Now pickup sound should play every time you pick up a coins, and coin should be removed from scene.

# Export

- Download and install export template : `Editor > Manage Exporter Template`.
- Access export settings: `Project > Export`
- Add desired platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Web)
- Configure export settings (icon, name, etc.)
- Click `Export Project` and choose output location
- Platform-specific notes:
	- Windows: Requires `.exe` export
	- Web: Exports to HTML5 (playable in browsers)
	- Mobile (Android, iOS): Requires additional setup (SDKs)
- Tips:
	- Test game thoroughly before exporting
	- Optimize assets for smaller file size
	- Adjust platform-specific settings for best performance

---
# Y-Sorting for 2.5D

- Create game scene with `Node2D` named TileMap and `Camera2D`.
- Add a player scene with `AnimationSprite2D`, `CollisionShape2D` and movement script to Game scene tree.
- Create three `TileMapLayer` named "ground", "cliff" and "y-sort" under TileMap.
- Enable `Y Sort` on game, player and layers.
- Paint tiles, physics layer as well as Y Sort Origin to these layers

---
# Enemy

```
Slime: 2D Node
	AnimatedSprite2D
	CollisionShape2D
	Detection_Area: Area2D
		CollisionShape2D
```

- Add 2nd physics layer to player and both layers + mask to slime.
- Also enable Y-Sorting

```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

@onready var player := $"../Player"

const SPEED := 100

var chase_player = false

func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
	if chase_player:
		var direction := global_position.direction_to(player.global_position)
		velocity = direction * SPEED
	else:
		velocity = velocity.move_toward(Vector2.ZERO, SPEED * delta)
	move_and_slide()

func _on_detection_area_body_entered(_body: Node2D) -> void:
	chase_player = true

func _on_detection_area_body_exited(_body: Node2D) -> void:
	chase_player = false
```

- Convert slime's Motion mode to "Floating" to make him not stick to player.
- Also simply use directions, velocity and vectors. Instead of modifying position. Keep it simple.

&gt; **Layers** determine what can detect me
&gt; **Masks** determine what can I detect


# Enemy Input

```gdscript

# Updates movement based on input and current state.
func _physics_process(_delta: float) -> void:
	if current_state == State.ATTACK_SWIPE:
		velocity = Vector2.ZERO
	elif current_state == State.ATTACK_JUMP:
		var progress: float = get_animation_progress()
		if progress > 0.1 and progress < 0.45:
			velocity = input_direction * JUMP_SPEED
		else:
			velocity = Vector2.ZERO
	else:
		# Get movement input.
		input_direction = Input.get_vector("ui_left", "ui_right", "ui_up", "ui_down")
		if input_direction != Vector2.ZERO:
			if Input.is_action_pressed("shift"):
				current_state = State.RUN
				velocity = input_direction * RUN_SPEED
			else:
				current_state = State.WALK
				velocity = input_direction * WALK_SPEED
		else:
			current_state = State.IDLE
			velocity = Vector2.ZERO
	move_and_slide()
```
