# DevObs

Welcome to my DevObs (get it? Development Obsidian, but to make it sound like DevOps. lol) knowledge hub.

Made with and to work as an Obsidian Vault. The idea is to document and organise my learnings for better understanding and future references.

With Obsidian's backlinks and graph like management of notes. I hope to achieve a Zettelkasten with a lot of interconnecting knowledge web.
