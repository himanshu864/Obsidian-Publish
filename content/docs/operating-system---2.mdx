## **Memory Management in OS**

In multiprogramming, there are many processes. and those processes run in RAM. But how are those processes stored on RAM? Might be continuous, or non-continuous. Might leave some space empty in between. But we know that physical addressing of processes will be different.

For example, both process 
```math
P_1
``` and 
```math
P_2
``` of 16kb has a **logical address** from 
```math
0
``` to 
```math
12800
``` bits. But they will have different **physical addresses**. 
```math
P_i
``` will have range 
```math
[R_i + 0, R_i + 12800]
```.
