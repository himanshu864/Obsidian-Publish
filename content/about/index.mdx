### A bit about me

- Integration Head of the **Recruitment Manager (RM) portal**, a microservices-based system powering placement operations for 9,000+ students and recruiters at DTU.  
- Currently building at **SceneZone**, a live entertainment booking startup connecting performers, hosts, and fans.  
- Problem solver at heart — earned **Knight rank on LeetCode** with a 600+ day streak.  
- Tinker with ideas: from a **news platform with a recommendation engine** ([Best News Aggregator](https://best-news-aggregator.vercel.app/)) to **game dev experiments** ([artoriax.itch.io](https://artoriax.itch.io/)) with Pygame and Godot.  
- I keep a **public knowledge repo** for notes and docs I make while learning — my second brain.

### Outside work  

Ask me about **Web & Game Dev, Productivity, Unix, Soulsborne games, Berserk manga, hip-hop/rock music, or just learning cool new things.**  

Fun fact: **I use Vim btw.**  

I also write (irregularly) on [Medium](https://medium.com/@himanshu86400).
